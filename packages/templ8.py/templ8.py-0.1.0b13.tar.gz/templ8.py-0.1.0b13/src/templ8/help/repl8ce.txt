	repl8ce

repl8ce keys are what allows your textile and markdown files to change parts of your html template.
In the html template, they look like this:

	##KEYVALUE##

You must set a default value for each key in repl8ce. Otherwise, when a file doesn't set a value for a key, it will error.
On a markdown or textile file, you can set the values of keys like this:

	KEY1=Value number one
	KEY2=a second value
	KEY3=
	-BEGINFILE-

The -BEGINFILE- keyword is important. It determines where the tags end and the content begins. KEY3's value is an empty string.

You can have multiline values like this:

	;;KEY4
	this
	is
	its
	value
	-BEGINFILE-

All multiline keys must go after every line key. The following is considered to be all part of KEY3.

	;;KEY5
	a
	value
	KEY6=another value

To set the default values of keys on repl8ce, simply use this same notation, without the -BEGINFILE- part. Default values can also be empty strings.

The ##CONTENT## keyword is actually a repl8ce key, it's just that its value is determined by the software and not by the user. Other key like this one is the ##LINK## key, which exists only in blogs. Fun!
