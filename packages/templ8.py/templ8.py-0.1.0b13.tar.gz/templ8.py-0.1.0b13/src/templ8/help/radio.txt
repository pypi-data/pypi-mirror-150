If all the blog core files aren't set up, it generates the basics required of a textile blog.")
Exports the blog to the output folder.

Core blog files and directories aren't renamable.

A blog requires a few things:

- A baseblog file, to model the article pages, article previews and blog index's repl8ce keys
- A blog directory as input
- An output/blog directory as output for the index
- An output/blog/posts directory as output for the articles

The baseblog is a complex file composed of three simple parts, all separated by a -BEGININDEX- keyword.

The first part of the baseblog is the article page template (from now on PAGE). The PAGEs correspond to specific articles, displaying them in full. It is a page file, so it has its own -BEGINPAGE- keyword. It also contains a ##CONTENT## key to put the content of the textile or markdown files.

The second part is the blog preview (from now on PREVIEW), which is the short part of the article that appears in the INDEX.

The blog index (the INDEX) is the part of the blog where all the PREVIEWs appear. The third part of the baseblog are the INDEX's repl8ce keys.

	How A File Is Processed

Each article of the blog in markdown on textile (from now on FILE) is processed separately.

Then, the content of the FILE is put in the PAGE. The FILE's repl8ce keys are applied to this PAGE, meaning that you can do things like:

	PAGETITLE=##ARTICLETITLE##

Where the value of ##ARTICLETITLE## is set by a FILE.

Then, this PAGE's content repl8ce keys are applied to the PREVIEW. This PREVIEW is then put in the INDEX. 

PREVIEWs are added to the INDEX in alphabetical order, not chronological.
