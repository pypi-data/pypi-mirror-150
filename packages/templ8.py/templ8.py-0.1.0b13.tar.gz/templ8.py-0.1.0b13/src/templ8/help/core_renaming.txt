	Core Renaming

Core renaming is a cool functionaility that allows you to rename most of the core directories and files.
It works thanks to the d8y file, which cannot be renamed. It uses the same format as single line repl8ce keys.
These are the core rename keys and the files they map to:\n

	KEY        ->   FILE/DIR
	------------>-----------
	replace    ->    repl8ce
	output     ->     output
	input      ->      input
	basehtml   ->   basehtml
	txignore   ->   txignore
