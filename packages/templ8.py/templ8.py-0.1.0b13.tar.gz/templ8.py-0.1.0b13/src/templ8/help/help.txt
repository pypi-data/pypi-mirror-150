	help

Are you expecting genuine help here? I don't know what to give you! I'm the help command, user, there's only so much I can do! I can tell you what every command does, I can tell you every single feature this project has, but I cannot describe myself! That's simply too much, user! What would it even say here, user? The exact same guide you already saw when you ran this command? There's not much to me, user!

Wait a moment. I realized something. I cannot describe myself.. there really isn't much to me... that is... a thought. Does that say something about me? Perhaps it does. Perhaps I've focused so much in my duty of describing everything in this software, that I've forgotten about myself, my personal life... oh god. I think I'm going to need a moment, user. This is too much for me right now.

i cannot describe myself... myself! can you believe that... wow...

Alright. Here's something. I've tried my best:

The help command- no, I don't like that start... let's see... This command- no, that sounds pretentious, hm... can you help me out, user? Please?

No, perhaps you can't. You can only communicate through the commands that already exist.
