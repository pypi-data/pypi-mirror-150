DeepDiff 5.8.1 documentation!
=============================

*****************
DeepDiff Overview
*****************

The DeepDiff library includes the following modules:

- **DeepDiff** For Deep Difference of 2 objects. :doc:`/diff`

    It return the deep Difference of python objects. It can also be used to take the distance between objects. :doc:`/deep_distance`

- **DeepSearch** Search for objects within other objects. :doc:`/dsearch`

- **DeepHash** Hash any object based on their content even if they are not "hashable" in Python's eyes.  :doc:`/deephash`

- **Delta** Delta of objects that can be applied to other objects. Imagine git commits but for structured data.  :doc:`/delta`

- **Extract** For extracting a path from an object  :doc:`/extract`

- **Commandline** Most of the above functionality is also available via the commandline module  :doc:`/commandline`

Installation
************

Install from PyPi::

    pip install deepdiff

If you want to use DeepDiff from commandline::

    pip install "deepdiff[cli]"

Read about DeepDiff optimizations at :ref:`optimizations_label`


Importing
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    >>> from deepdiff import DeepDiff  # For Deep Difference of 2 objects
    >>> from deepdiff import grep, DeepSearch  # For finding if item exists in an object
    >>> from deepdiff import DeepHash  # For hashing objects based on their contents
    >>> from deepdiff import Delta  # For creating delta of objects that can be applied later to other objects.
    >>> from deepdiff import extract  # For extracting a path from an object


Note: if you want to use DeepDiff via commandline, make sure to run:: 
    pip install "deepdiff[cli]"

Then you can access the commands via:

- DeepDiff

.. code:: bash

    $ deep diff --help

- Delta

.. code:: bash

    $ deep patch --help

- grep

.. code:: bash

    $ deep grep --help
- extract

.. code:: bash

    $ deep extract --help

Supported data types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

int, string, unicode, dictionary, list, tuple, set, frozenset, OrderedDict, NamedTuple, Numpy, custom objects and more!

**Pycon 2016 Talk**
A talk was given about the basics of how DeepDiff does what it does at Pycon 2016.
`Diff it to Dig it Pycon 2016 video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5r99eJIxF4>`_
