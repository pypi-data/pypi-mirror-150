Thank you also to everyone who has helped via email, in discussions
on GitHub, and on `software underground <https://swung.slack.com>`__!

Your help is very welcome! No contribution is too small. You can help with the
documentation, adding example notebooks, posting ideas or feature requests to
GitHub, or by working on the code - or anything else!

Places you can help
----------------------------

* Please don’t hesitate to open a
  `GitHub issue <https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio/issues/new>`__
  for any problems you are having with lasio, or any ideas for improvements.
  There are templates to guide you in how to file a 
  `bug report <https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=>`__,
  or a `request for a new feature or improvement <https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=>`__.
  If you are not sure whether your issue fits under these categories, please
  go ahead and `raise <https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio/issues/new>`__ one anyway!

* Please feel free to contribute suggested changes. The easiest method is to
  fork lasio on GitHub and
  `submit a pull request <https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio/pulls>`__
  against the "master" branch. Don’t worry about getting all the details right,
  either way it’s still the most convenient way for me or other maintainers to
  see your changes in context.

* Example LAS files: if you have an
  interesting/difficult/silly/standards-challenged LAS file (any version) you
  would be willing to share with me, please do so! Email it to me at
  `kinverarity@hotmail.com <kinverarity@hotmail.com>`__. The more examples we can
  incorporate into lasio’s regression testing, the better. If you have concerns
  about privacy, I’d suggest obfuscating with find-and-replace on various alpha
  (or numeric) characters before sending it on, and/or deleting any sensitive header
  lines.

How to make contributions
-------------------------

Contributions are always welcome to the code, documentation, or example
notebooks. If you are making a contribution, please make sure you are
working off the latest GitHub master. You will want to make your contributions
in a branch taken from `master`, and then when you want to share your changes,
you can publish them by "pushing" your branch to your GitHub fork of the lasio
repository, and opening a PR (pull request) here.

First, create a fork of the lasio repository using the GitHub website. Then
clone your fork locally to your computer::

  $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/lasio
  $ cd lasio

Your fork will be called the "origin" repository - you'll need to know this for
when you push/pull changes to and from your computer.

Adding kinverarity1/lasio as "upstream"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now also add the kinverarity1/lasio repository as the "upstream" repository. This is so that
when other people make changes to kinverarity1/lasio, you can "pull" those changes into
your local copy::

  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio

To update the `master` branch of the local copy you have of your fork from the "upstream" repository::

  $ git checkout master
  $ git pull upstream master

And to update the GitHub fork from your local copy::

  $ git checkout master
  $ git push origin master
  
Making sure you have necessary development dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some additional packages you needing for running unit/regression tests (`pytest`) and
formatting Python code (`black`). You can install these easily by using::

  $ pip install --editable .[test]

Making changes to the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, start by making sure your local copy is using the latest copy of code from "upstream" master (see above).
Then create a branch - you can call it whatever is meaningful to you. We switch to `master` so that
your changes are relative to the latest copy of the code in `master`::

  $ git checkout master
  $ git checkout -b your-branch-name
  Switched to a new branch 'your-branch-name'

  (your-branch-name) $

Then you can make your changes. To test them, make sure you have an "editable"
installation of lasio in your Python environment. Shift to the root folder
of the repository and run::

  $ pip install -e .

Then to run all the tests::

  $ pytest

Before publishing your changes please make the code is formatted using `black <https://github.com/psf/black>`__::

  $ black .

Then you can push your changes to your fork::

  $ git push origin your-branch-name

And follow the instructions on your fork's GitHub page to open a pull request (PR) for lasio!

Making changes to the documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just as valuable as changes to the code, are changes or improvements to the 
`Sphinx documentation <https://lasio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__! If you would like to help in this regard, you will
need Sphinx and IPython installed::

  $ pip install sphinx IPython sphinx_rtd_theme

Then create a new branch as above. The documentation is written in RestructuredText,
and can be found in the `docs/source` subfolder of the lasio repository. If you
have any changes, you can build a local copy of the HTML repository to test how it
looks. First change into the docs folder::

  $ cd docs

Then run this to generate a local copy of the HTML docs in the `build/html` folder::

  $ make clean
  $ make html
  
Once you are happy, please publish your branch and open a PR in the same way as above.
