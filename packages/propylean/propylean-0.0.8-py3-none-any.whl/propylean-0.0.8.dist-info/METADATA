# Propylean
#### The open-source analytics package for chemical process industries

## What is Propylean
Propylean name is derived from words Process/Production + Python + lean programming/manufacturing.
Propylean is a Python library which will help engineers simulate production plants focusing on chemical and related process industries using only Python environments. 
By coupling this library with available data analysis/machine learning frameworks, engineers will be able to enhace operations of their plants. Ultimate aspiration of this project is to enable process industries transit to zero carbon operation.

## Objective
To increase the utilization of open-source software and analytics tools in the chemical and related industries.

## Vision
Vision of Propylean is to:
- Enable chemical and related industries to use analytics and ML frameworks
- Improve operational agility and efficiency of the plant
- Be a cheap simulation-software alternative for small manufacturers
- Help the industry transition to Net-Zero emissions
- Inculcate coding/programing skills in manufacturing engineers

## Installation and Requirements
When published in PyPi, user will be able to download using pip or directly from PyPi website. 

Pip command:
`pip install propylean`
