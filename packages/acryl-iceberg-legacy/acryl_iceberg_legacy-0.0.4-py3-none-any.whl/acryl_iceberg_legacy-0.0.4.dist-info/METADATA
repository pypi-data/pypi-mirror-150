# Iceberg Python

Iceberg is a python library for programatic access to iceberg table metadata as well as data access. The intention is to provide a functional subset of the java library.

## Getting Started

Iceberg python is currently in development, for development and testing purposes the best way to install the library is to perform the following steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/iceberg.git
cd iceberg/python_legacy
pip install -e .
```

## Testing

Testing is done using tox. The config can be found in `tox.ini` within the python directory of the iceberg project.

```
# simply run tox from within the python dir
tox
```
