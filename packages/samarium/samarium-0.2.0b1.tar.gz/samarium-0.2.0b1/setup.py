The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/samarium-lang/vscode-samarium).\n\n\n# Credits\n\nSamarium was inspired by several languages, including [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Java](https://www.java.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).\nThanks to [tetraxile](https://github.com/tetraxile) for helping with design choices and writing the docs, [MithicSpirit](https://github.com/MithicSpirit) for making Samarium an AUR package, and [DarviL82](https://github.com/DarviL82) for fixing some issues.\n\nIf you have any questions, or would like to get in touch, join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/C8QE5tVQEq)!',
