:navy:`SMAP haplotype-sites: using polymorphic sites (SNPs, SVs, and/or SMAPs) for read-backed haplotyping`

| **SMAP haplotype-sites** reconstructs multi-allelic haplotypes based on a predefined set of polymorphisms at Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), breakpoints of Structural Variants (SVs) and/or Stack Mapping Anchor Points (:ref:`SMAPs <SMAPdeldef>`) through read-backed haplotyping.
| **SMAP haplotype-sites** can be used for \`stacked´ \ read data such as Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS) or highly multiplex amplicon sequencing (HiPlex), and for random fragmented (e.g. Shotgun Sequencing) read data.  

.. image:: ../images/sites/SMAP_sites_introduction_scheme.png

:navy:`SMAP haplotype-sites only requires this input:`
	
	1. a single BED file to define the start and end points of loci (loci created by :ref:`SMAP delineate <SMAPdelHIW>` for GBS, amplicon regions for HiPlex, and Sliding frames for Shotgun sequencing).
	2. a single VCF file containing bi-allelic SNPs obtained with third-party SNP calling software.
	3. a set of indexed BAM files for all samples that need to be compared.

| **SMAP haplotype-sites** performs read-backed haplotyping, per sample, per locus, per read, using positional information of read alignments and creates multi-allelic haplotypes from a short string of polymorphic *sites* (ShortHaps).
| **SMAP haplotype-sites** takes a conservative approach, without any form of imputation or phase extension, and strictly considers SNPs and/or SMAPs within a read for read-backed haplotyping.
| **SMAP haplotype-sites** filters out genotype calls of loci with low read counts, and low frequency haplotypes, to control for noise in the data.
| **SMAP haplotype-sites** creates a multi-allelic genotype call matrix listing haplotype calls, per sample, per locus, across the sample set.
| **SMAP haplotype-sites** always returns quantitative haplotype frequencies, useful for Pool-Seq data.
| **SMAP haplotype-sites** can also create discrete haplotype calls (expressed as either dominant or dosage calls) for individual samples.
| **SMAP haplotype-sites** plots the haplotype frequency distribution per sample.
| **SMAP haplotype-sites** plots a histogram of the number of haplotypes per locus across the sample set to show the haplotype diversity.

:navy:`Loci with sets of polymorphic sites`

| In the SMAP haplotype-sites workflow, the user first selects loci known to be covered by reads across the sample set. For HiPlex data, pairs of primers define locus positions. SNPs identified by third-party software that are located within these loci are combined into haplotypes, all other SNPs and all other non-polymorphic positions are excluded. For Shotgun data, dynamic sliding frames are used that bundle neighboring SNPs, based on a VCF file with known SNPs obtained by third-party software. For GBS data, read mapping polymorphisms (SMAPs, see :ref:`SMAP delineate <SMAPdelsepvmerg>`) define locus positions and may be combined with SNPs as molecular markers for haplotyping. (See for third-party SNP calling software: `SAMtools <http://www.htslib.org/>`_, `BEDtools <https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_, `Freebayes <https://github.com/ekg/freebayes>`_, or `GATK <https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us>`_ for individuals, or `SNAPE-pooled <https://github.com/EmanueleRaineri/snape-pooled>`_ for Pool-Seq data. See also `Veeckman et al, 2019 <https://academic.oup.com/dnaresearch/article/26/1/1/5133005>`_ for a comparison of methods).

In order to comply with bedtools, which generates the locus \- \ SNP overlap, a 9-column VCF format with VCFv4.2-style header is required.

The GBS fragment is flanked on both sides by a *Pst* I restriction site (grey box) and contains two independent loci. The first locus contains single-end reads mapped on the forward (+) strand. 
			| The second locus contains reads mapped on the reverse (-) strand. Haplotypes are defined by combinations of neighboring SMAPs (light blue arrows) and SNPs (purple arrows). A SMAP at position 15622 is created by an InDel close to the \5' \ of the GBS-fragment combined with a misalignment (see :ref:`SMAP delineate <SMAPdelsepvmerg>` for details), while a SMAP at position 15792 is created by consistent soft clipping in a particular haplotype. Various sequencing read errors are present at positions other than the identified SNP positions, but are ignored as they are not listed in the VCF file. One of the SNPs (15793) is located in the soft clipped region.

	  | **SMAP haplotype-sites** first creates sets of polymorphic positions per locus on the reference genome by intersecting locus regions (obtained with :ref:`SMAP delineate <SMAPdelHIW>`) with a VCF file containing selected SNPs (obtained from any third-party SNP calling algorithm applied to the same set of BAM files). 
	  | In each BAM file, **SMAP haplotype-sites** then evaluates each read-reference alignment for the nucleotide aligned at the SMAP/SNP positions and scores as follows:

	  ========= ===================================================================================
	  CALL TYPE CLASSES
	  ========= ===================================================================================
	  .         absence of read mapping
	  0         presence of the reference nucleotide
	  1         presence of an alternative nucleotide (any nucleotide different from the reference)
	  \- \      presence of a gap in the alignment
	  ========= ===================================================================================
	
	  These calls are concatenated into a haplotype string of \'.01-'\s. For each discovered haplotype in the data, the total number of corresponding reads is counted per sample. Next, the haplotype counts of all samples are integrated into one master table, and expressed as relative haplotype frequency per locus per sample. Haplotypes with low frequency across all samples are removed to control for noise. The final table with haplotype frequencies per locus per sample is the end point for analysis of Pool-Seq data. Using the :ref:`option <SMAPhaploquickstartcommands>` ``--discrete_calls``, **SMAP haplotype-sites** transforms the haplotype frequency table into discrete haplotype calls for individuals.

	  Three modes may be chosen for discrete haplotype calling in individuals:
	  
	  ============================= =============
	  CALL TYPE                     CLASSES
	  ============================= =============
	  dosage calls in diploids      0, 1, 2
	  dosage calls in tetraploids   0, 1, 2, 3, 4
	  dominant calls                0, 1
	  ============================= =============

	  In the following sections, identification and quantification of haplotypes is illustrated on single-end GBS read data of a set of 8 diploid individuals at two partially overlapping loci. The content of the three example input files (BED, VCF, BAM) at this locus will be used to demonstrate the subsequent steps of **SMAP haplotype-sites**.

**Tabular output**

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: General output

      By default, **SMAP haplotype-sites** will return two .tsv files.  
 
      :navy:`haplotype counts`
      
      **Read_counts_cx_fx_mx.tsv** (with x the value per option used in the analysis) contains the read counts (``-c``) and haplotype frequency (``-f``) filtered and/or masked (``-m``) read counts per haplotype per locus as defined in the BED file from **SMAP delineate**.  
      This is the file structure:

      :navy:`relative haplotype frequency`
      
      **Haplotype_frequencies_cx_fx_mx.tsv** contains the relative frequency per haplotype per locus in sample (based on the corresponding count table: Read_counts_cx_fx_mx.tsv). The transformation to relative frequency per locus-sample combination inherently normalizes for differences in total number of mapped reads across samples, and differences in amplification efficiency across loci.  
      This is the file structure:

   .. tab:: Additional output for individuals
   
      For individuals, if the option ``--discrete_calls`` is used, the program will return three additional .tsv files. Their content and order of creation is shown in :ref:`this scheme <SMAPhaplostep5>`.  
      
	  | :navy:`haplotype total discrete calls`
      
	  | The first file is called **haplotypes_cx_fx_mx_discrete_calls._total.tsv** and this file contains the total dosage calls, obtained after transforming haplotype frequencies into discrete calls, using the defined ``--frequency_interval_bounds``. The total sum of discrete dosage calls is expected to be 2 in diploids and 4 in tetraploids.

	  | :navy:`haplotype discrete calls`
	  
	  | The second file is **haplotypes_cx_fx_mx-discrete_calls_filtered.tsv**, which lists the discrete calls per locus per sample after ``--dosage_filter`` has removed loci per sample with an unexpected number of haplotype calls (as listed in haplotypes_cx_fx_mx_discrete_calls_total.tsv). The expected number of calls is set with option ``-z`` [use 2 for diploids, 4 for tetraploids].

	  | The third file, **haplotypes_cx_fx_mx_Pop_HF.tsv**, lists the population haplotype frequencies (over all individual samples) based on the total number of discrete haplotype calls relative to the total number of calls per locus.

	  | For individuals, if the option ``--locus_correctness`` is used in combination with ``--discrete_calls`` and ``--frequency_interval_bounds``, the programm will create a new .bed file **haplotypes_cx_fx_mx_correctnessx_loci.bed** (loci filtered from the input .bed file) containing only the loci that were correctly dosage called (-z) in at least the defined percentage of samples. :ref:`See above <SMAPhaplostep5>`.

**Graphical output**

:navy:`haplotype diversity`

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: haplotype diversity across sampleset
	
	 By default, **SMAP haplotype-sites** will generate graphical output summarizing haplotype diversity. haplotype_diversity_across_sampleset.png shows a histogram of the number of distinct haplotypes per locus *across* all samples.  
     
   .. tab:: example graph
	
	  .. image:: ../images/sites/haplotype_counts.cigar.barplot.png


:navy:`haplotype frequency distribution per sample`

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: haplotype frequency distribution per sample
	 
     Graphical output of the haplotype frequency distribution for each individual sample can be switched **on** using the option ``--plot_all``. sample_haplotype_frequency_distribution.png shows the haplotype frequency distribution across all loci detected per sample. It is the graphical representation of each sample-specific column in **haplotypes_cx_fx_mx.tsv**. Using the option ``--discrete_calls``, this plot will also show the defined discrete calling boundaries.

:navy:`quality of genotype calls per locus and per sample (only for individuals)`

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: QC of loci and samples using discrete dosage calls  
	
     After discrete genotype calling with option ``--discrete_calls``, **SMAP haplotype-sites** will evaluate the observed sum of discrete dosage calls per locus per sample versus the expected value per locus (set with option ``-z``, recommended use: 2 for diploid, 4 for tetraploid). 
     
     The quality of genotype calls per *sample* is calculated in two ways: the fraction of loci with calls in that sample versus the total number of loci across all samples (sample_call_completeness); the fraction of loci with expected sum of discrete dosage calls (``-z``) versus the total number of observed loci in that sample (sample_call_correctness.tsv). These scores are calculated separately per *sample*, and **SMAP haplotype-sites** plots the distribution of those scores across the sample set (sample_call_completeness.png; sample_call_correctness.png).  
      
     Similarly, the quality of genotype calls per *locus* is calculated in two ways: the fraction of samples with calls for that locus versus the total number of samples (locus_call_completeness); the fraction of samples with expected sum of discrete dosage calls (``-z``) versus the total number of observed samples for that locus (locus_call_correctness.tsv). These scores are calculated separately per *locus*, and **SMAP haplotype-sites** plots the distribution of those scores across the locus set (locus_call_completeness.png; locus_call_correctness.png).  
      
     Both graphs and the corresponding tables (one for samples and one for loci) can be evaluated to identify poorly performing samples and/or loci. We recommend to eliminate these from further analysis by removing BAM files from the run directory and/or loci from the SMAP delineate BED file with SMAPs, and iterate through rounds of data analysis combined with sample and locus quality control.

   .. tab:: completeness and correctness across the sample set
	
	  .. image:: ../images/sites/sample_call_completeness_correctness_40canephora.png
	  
	  The sample call completeness plot shows the percentage of loci that have data across the samples after all filters. In read depth-saturated, low diversity datasets, the majority of samples should have high locus completeness and there should not be much variation in completeness between samples. In a high diversity or read depth-unsaturated sample set, locus completeness per sample will be lower and more spread out.
	  
	  The sample call correctness plot displays the percentage of correctly dosage called (``-z``) loci across the sampleset. Loci are only masked in samples with a dosage value different from ``-z`` but remain in the data set for all other samples with the expected dosage value.
	  
   .. tab:: completeness and correctness across the locus set
	
	  .. image:: ../images/sites/locus_call_completeness_correctness_40canephora.png

	  The locus call completeness plot displays the percentage of samples that have data (after every filter) on a locus for every locus. In read depth-saturated, low diversity sample sets, the majority of samples should have many high completeness loci and few low completeness loci. In a high diversity or read depth-unsaturated sample set, many loci will have a low completeness.
	  
	  The locus call correctness plot shows the percentage of samples that were correctly dosage called (``-z``) across the locus set. Loci with low correctness values indicate potential genotype calling artefacts and should be removed from the data set.
