Description: 
        What is DIONE?
        **************
        
        DIONE is a family of software applications that the JRC has been
        developing since 2014 to support EU transport emission reduction
        policies. It is presently employed to support road vehicle CO:sub:`2`
        emissions standards within ECâ€™s Fit for 55 package. It has also been
        supporting the European Strategy for Low-Emission Mobility.
        
        The assessment of the costs of potential road vehicle CO:sub:`2`
        emissions standards is carried out through the following computational
        modules:
        
        *  DIONE Cost Curve Module: Develops CO:sub:`2` reduction cost curves,
           applying an optimisation technique, which provide cost estimates
           associated with reaching a given CO:sub:`2` reduction for different
           vehicle segments and powertrains.
        
        *  DIONE Cross-Optimization and Energy Consumption Module: Identifies
           cost-optimal strategies to reach given emission targets and
           respective vehicle manufacturing costs, building on the cost
           curves. Cross-optimization outcomes can be used to assess the
           impact of different policy options on manufacturing costs for
           different manufacturer categories, contributing to the economic
           assessment.
        
        *  DIONE Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Module: Computes total costs of
           ownership under different regulation options, summarizing the
           results from the previous steps and adding in operation and
           maintenance costs. Results allow assessing the societal costs
           associated with a policy option, as well as the costs for consumers
           (new vehicle buyers and second-hand vehicle buyers).
        
        
        Installation
        ************
        
        To install it use (with root privileges):
        
        .. code:: console
        
           $ pip install dione
        
        Or download the last git version and use (with root privileges):
        
        .. code:: console
        
           $ python setup.py install
        
        
        Install extras
        ==============
        
        Some additional functionality is enabled installing the following
        extras:
        
        *  cli: enables the command line interface.
        
        *  gui: enables the graphical user interface.
        
        *  plot: enables to plot the model process and its workflow.
        
        *  dev: installs all libraries plus the development libraries.
        
        To install DIONE and all extras (except development libraries), do:
        
        .. code:: console
        
           $ pip install 'dione[all]'
