        Why: it is strongly encouraged to ensure all modulemds are put into repos
        before we start putting RPMs into them, to reduce the risk that we could
        accidentally expose an RPM without the corresponding modulemd as that
        can break systems consuming the repos. Therefore we need to ensure any
        module items are processed before we can proceed to associate any RPM
        items.

        Note this potentially could be made smarter by, for example, tracking
        the state of modulemds for each repo, or even fully tracking the
        dependencies between each modulemd and the RPMs referenced by it, but
        it's unclear whether the additional complexity would be worth it.
