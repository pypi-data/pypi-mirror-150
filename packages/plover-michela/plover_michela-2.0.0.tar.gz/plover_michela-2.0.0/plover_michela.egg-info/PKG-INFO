## Release history

### 2.0.0

* The theory has been updated to take full advantage of the inflectional suffixes
  based on grammar rules recently introduced. In particular:
  - The rules to indicate the endings of the words "e" and "i" have been modified
    to avoid conflicts caused by the previous diphthong-based system (for a full
    description refer to the Michela theory manual on GitHub).
  - The numeric dictionary' strokes have been changed (from `IU` to `Uu`) in
    order to avoid a series of possible conflicts.
  - The syllabic finger-spelling system has been modified: it now uses the
    combination `RX` and `RXI` for capital letters.
* Numerous definitions relating to prefixes / suffixes and formatting commands
  have been amended.
