Description: # npy-cpp-patches
        Read N-Dimensional patches from `.npy` files. This module is built using `C++` and has `Python3` bindings.
        
        ## Data Specifications
        
        - Arrays must be saved in `C-contiguous` format, i.e. **NOT** `Fortran-contiguous`.
        - First dimension is indexed using `qspace_index`, and therefore is a non-contiguous patch dimension.
        - Next dimensions are specified by a patch shape `C++` vector or `Python` tuple. To extract patches of lower dimensionality than that of the data, set the corresponding dimensions to `1`.
        
        
        ## Python Usage
        
        ### Install
        ```pip install cpp-npy-patcher```
        
        ### Usage
        ```python
        
        from npy_patcher import PatcherDouble, PatcherFloat, PatcherInt, PatcherLong
        
        
        
        ```
