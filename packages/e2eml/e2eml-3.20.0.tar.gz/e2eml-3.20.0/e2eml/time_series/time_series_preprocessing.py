        KPSS is another test for checking the stationarity of a time series (slightly less popular than the Dickey
        Fuller test). The null and alternate hypothesis for the KPSS test are opposite that of the ADF test,

        The authors of the KPSS test have defined the null hypothesis as the process is trend stationary,
        to an alternate hypothesis of a unit root series.
        - Null Hypothesis: The process is trend stationary.

        What are the different types of stationarity?
        - Strict Stationary: A strict stationary series satisfies the mathematical definition of a stationary process.
          For a strict stationary series, the mean, variance and covariance are not the function of time.
          The aim is to convert a non-stationary series into a strict stationary series for making predictions.
        - Trend Stationary: A series that has no unit root but exhibits a trend is referred to as a trend stationary
          series. Once the trend is removed, the resulting series will be strict stationary. The KPSS test classifies a
          series as stationary on the absence of unit root. This means that the series can be strict stationary or
          trend stationary.
        - Difference Stationary: A time series that can be made strict stationary by differencing falls under difference
          stationary. ADF test is also known as a difference stationarity test.

        Itâ€™s always better to apply both the tests, so that we are sure that the series is truly stationary.
        Let us look at the possible outcomes of applying these stationary tests.

        - Case 1: Both tests conclude that the series is not stationary -> series is not stationary
        - Case 2: Both tests conclude that the series is stationary -> series is stationary
        - Case 3: KPSS = stationary and ADF = not stationary -> trend stationary, remove the trend to make series
          strict stationary
        - Case 4: KPSS = not stationary and ADF = stationary -> difference stationary, use differencing to make series
          stationary
