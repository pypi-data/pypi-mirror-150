# Dynamic Learning Technique

Dynamic learning technique allows the user to train a model in batch wise manner

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Exchange Rate Api

```bash
pip install Dynamic-Learning-Technique
```

## Usage

The DLT takes 2 argument with 6 optional arguments

```python
# Initialize an object to DLT
from DLT import *
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
import asyncio


async def main():
    obj = DLT(['X dataset'], ['Y dataset'], DecisionTreeRegressor())
    await obj.start()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Features

- ## **Algorithms Supported**
  New supported algorithms has been included
    - RandomForestClassifier
    - DecisionTreeClassifier
    - SVC
    - RandomForestRegressor
    - DecisionTreeRegressor
    - LinearRegression
    - LogisticRegression
    - SVR
    - Ridge

- ## **Exception**
  New exceptions has been included
    - NoArgumentException
    - InvalidMachineLearningModel
    - InvalidDatasetProvided
    - BatchCountGreaterThanBatchSize


- ## **Parallel Processing**
    - The splitting process has been made an asynchronous process in order to increase the speed of the splitting
      process
