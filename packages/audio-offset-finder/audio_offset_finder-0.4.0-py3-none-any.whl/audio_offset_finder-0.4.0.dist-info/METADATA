audio-offset-finder
===================

A simple tool and library for finding the offset of an audio file within another file.

Uses cross-correlation of standardised Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients,
so should be relatively robust to noise (encoding, compression, etc).  The accuracy is typically to within about 0.01s.

The tool outputs the calculated offset in seconds, and a "standard score" representing the prominence of the chosen correlation peak.  This can be used as an estimate of the accuracy of the calculated offset - one with a score greater than ten is likely to be correct (at least for audio without similar repeated sections) within the accuracy of the tool; an offset with a score less than five is unlikely to be correct, and a manual check should be carried out.

The tool uses ffmpeg for transcoding, so should work on all file formats supported by ffmpeg.

Installation
------------

To install from this source directory once downloaded:

    $ pip install .

Or, to install the latest package from PyPi.org:

    $ pip install audio-offset-finder

Usage
-----

    $ audio-offset-finder --help
    $ audio-offset-finder --find-offset-of file1.wav --within file2.wav
    Offset: 12.26 (seconds)
    Standard score: 21.102

To provide additional information about the accuracy of the result in addition to the standard score, the --plot option shows a plot of the cross-correlation curve.  A single well-defined peak such as is shown in the image below is a good indication that the offset is correct.
