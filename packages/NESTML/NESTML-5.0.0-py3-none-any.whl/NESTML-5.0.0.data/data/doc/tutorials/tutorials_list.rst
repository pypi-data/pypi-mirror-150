Creating neuron models
----------------------

* :doc:`Izhikevich tutorial </tutorials/izhikevich/nestml_izhikevich_tutorial>`

  Learn how to write the Izhikevich spiking neuron model in NESTML.

* :doc:`Active dendrite tutorial </tutorials/active_dendrite/nestml_active_dendrite_tutorial>`

  Learn how to model a dendritic action potential in an existing NESTML neuron.

* :doc:`Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise </tutorials/ornstein_uhlenbeck_noise/nestml_ou_noise_tutorial>`

  Implement the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in NESTML and use it to inject a noise current into a neuron.


Creating synapse models
-----------------------

* :doc:`STDP windows </tutorials/stdp_windows/stdp_windows>`

  An STDP window describes how the strength of the synapse changes as a function of the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes. Several different STDP model variants with different window functions are implemented.

* :doc:`Triplet STDP synapse </tutorials/triplet_stdp_synapse/triplet_stdp_synapse>`

  A triplet STDP rule is sensitive to third-order correlations of pre- and postsynaptic spike times, and accounts better for experimentally seen dependence on timing and frequency.
