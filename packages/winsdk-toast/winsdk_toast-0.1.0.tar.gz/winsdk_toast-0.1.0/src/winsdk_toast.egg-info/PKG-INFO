# winsdk_toast

A simple package for displaying Windows Toast Notification based on [winsdk].

Sometimes, after starting my data processing python script, I may surf the Internet.
It chokes my happiness that to frequently check whether the script stops,
or suddenly realize the script has stopped for a long while.

It'll be reassuring that the script can stop with a friendly gesture.

## Features

winsdk_toast can pop up Windows Toast Notifications that contain

- [x] Text
- [x] Image
- [x] Input
  - [x] Text
  - [x] Selection
- [x] Audio
  - [x] Buit-in
  - [ ] Custom
- [x] Progress
  - [x] Still
  - [ ] Live
- [x] Group
- [x] Event

## Minimal Example

```python
from winsdk_toast import Notifier, Toast


notifier = Notifier('程序名 applicationId')
toast = Toast()
toast.add_text('第一行 1st line')
notifier.show(toast)
```
