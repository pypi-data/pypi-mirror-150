pip install bomapi

# Pipenv
pipenv install bomapi

# Poetry
poetry add bomapi
```

## Usage

### Find a location

```python
import bomapi

results = bomapi.location_search("Wollongong")
for result in results:
    print(result.name)
```

### Get data from a location

```python
import bomapi

geohash = "r3gk6rr"  # Wollongong (or use the result object from location_search)
location = bomapi.Location(geohash)

observations = location.observations()
print(observations.rain_since_9am)
```

### Async support

```python
import bomapi.aio

geohash = "r3gk6rr"  # Wollongong
location = bomapi.aio.Location(geohash)

observations = await location.observations()
print(observations.rain_since_9am)
```
