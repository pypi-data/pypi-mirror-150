# VASP Plot Suite
### (C) AG 2022

Vasp Plot Suite is a program for processing and plotting electronic structure data
from VASP calculations output. It has two modules:

a) DosApp: for plotting electronic density of states (eDOS),<br>
b) BandsApp: for plotting electronic band structure.

Instructions for each of module can be found in their respective README files.

After importing <code>vaspplotsuite</code>, just type <code>vaspplotsuite.run()</code> to run the program.

### Executables
This program can be compliled into an executable.
I can provide ones for Windows or MacOS upon request.

### This program is still being tested
If you notice any errors or discrepancies, or if you have any practical suggestions,
I would be grateful if you report them.
I have also included sample data for AgF2 system if you want to give it a try.
