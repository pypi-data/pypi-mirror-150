This is a simple auto-login bot using python. In this present scenario, every website uses authentication and we have to log in by entering proper credentials. But sometimes it becomes very hectic to login again and again to a particular website. So, to come out of this problem lets, built our own auto login bot using python.

We will be using Selenium (python library) for making the auto-login bot. Python Selenium library helps us to access all functionalities of Selenium WebDriver like Firefox, Chrome, Remote etc.

Installation
First we have to install Selenium using below command: 
-- pip install selenium

Stepwise Implementation:
-- First of all import the webdrivers from the selenium library.
-- Find the URL of the login page to which you want to logged in.
-- Provide the location executable chrome driver to selenium webdriver to access the chrome browser.
-- Finally, find the name or id or class or CSS selector of username and password by right-clicking inspect on username and password.
