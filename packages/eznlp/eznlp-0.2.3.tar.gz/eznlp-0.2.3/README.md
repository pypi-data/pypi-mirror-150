# Easy Natural Language Processing

Neural networks are lazy (Chizat et al., 2019), and they learn shortcuts (Geirhos et al., 2020), so we design structures and objectives that can be easily optimized for better solutions. 

`eznlp` is a `PyTorch`-based package for neural natural language processing, currently supporting the following tasks:

* Text Classification ([Experimental Results](docs/text-classification.pdf))
* Named Entity Recognition ([Experimental Results](docs/entity-recognition.pdf))
    * Sequence Tagging
    * Span Classification
    * Boundary Selection
* Relation Extraction ([Experimental Results](docs/relation-extraction.pdf))
* Attribute Extraction
* Machine Translation
* Image Captioning

This repository also maintains the code of our papers: 
* Check this [link](docs/boundary-smoothing.md) for "Boundary Smoothing for Named Entity Recognition" accepted to ACL 2022 main conference. 


## Installation

## Future Plans
- [ ] Unify the data interchange format as a dict, i.e., `entry`
- [ ] Reorganize `JsonIO`
- [ ] Memory optimization for large dataset for training PLM
- [ ] More relation extraction models
- [ ] Multihot classification
- [ ] Unify the aggregation interface of pooling and attention
- [ ] Radical-level features
- [ ] Data augmentation
- [ ] Loss increases in later training phases -> LR finder?
