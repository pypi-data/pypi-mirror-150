        # japanese-candlestick-pattern
        
        # Install
        `pip install japanese-candlestick` 
        
        # Usage
        
        Assuming having a pandas DataFrame `candles` with the following columns:
        - `'Open'`
        - `'High`
        - `'Low'`
        - `'Close'`
        
        One can compute the japanese candlestick pattern Engulfing as follow:
        ```python
        from patterns import Engulfing
        
        # Instantiate the pattern, with the candles dataframe as arg
        engulfing = Engulfing(candles)
        
        # Perform pattern detection
        output_df = engulfing.compute_pattern()
        ```
        The pattern detection value (a bool) is stored in a column having the same name as the pattern (lower case).
        In above example, the results would be in `output_df['engulfing']`.
        
        # Available patterns
        
        The patterns are computed based on the book 'Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques', by Steve Nison.
        
        The currently available patterns are the following:
        - Doji
        - DragonflyDoji
        - Engulfing
        - GraveswtoneDoji
        - Hammer
        - HangingMan
        - Harami
        - InvertedHammer
        - LongleggedDoji
        - ShootingStar
        - ThreeWhiteSoldiers
        - ThreeBlackCrows
        
        They are all to be imported from `patterns`, and all with the same usage (and sometimes parameters), i.e.:
        
        ```python
        # First import
        from patterns import Hammer
        # Then instantiate
        hammer = Hammer(candles)
        # Finally compute detection
        output_df = hammer.compute_pattern()
        ```
