Fork of the [aws > aws-step-functions-data-science-sdk-python](https://github.com/aws/aws-step-functions-data-science-sdk-python).

Stripped version of the original repo - AWS Step Functions Data Science SDK. Contains only code for building 
[Amazon States Language]() state machines.

Does not contain code for integrating with various AWS services. If you need integration with Sagemaker, Lambda etc. -
use original repo [aws > aws-step-functions-data-science-sdk-python](https://github.com/aws/aws-step-functions-data-science-sdk-python).
