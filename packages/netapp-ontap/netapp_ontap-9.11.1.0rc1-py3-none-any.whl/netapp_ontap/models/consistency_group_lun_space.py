This value is the total space consumed in the volume by the LUN, including filesystem overhead, but excluding prefix and suffix streams. Due to internal filesystem overhead and the many ways SAN filesystems and applications utilize blocks within a LUN, this value does not necessarily reflect actual consumption/availability from the perspective of the filesystem or application. Without specific knowledge of how the LUN blocks are utilized outside of ONTAP, this property should not be used as an indicator for an out-of-space condition.<br/>
