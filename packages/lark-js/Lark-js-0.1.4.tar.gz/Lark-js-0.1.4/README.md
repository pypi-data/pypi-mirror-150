# Lark.js

**Generate LALR(1) parsers in Javascript**

Lark is a popular parsing toolkit for Python.

This project is a live port of the Lark standalone parser to Javascript.

**Lark.js** takes a `.lark` grammar, and from it generates a standalone Javascript parser.

The LALR(1) algorithm guarantees O(n) running time (proportional to input length), and minimal memory consumption.

### Lark grammars

Lark grammars are written in an augmented EBNF (a textual format), and usually use the `.lark` extension.

Because they are purely declarative, and don't contain code, they are entirely portable between languages.

It is now possible to use Lark grammars in 3 languages: Python, Javascript, and Julia.

#### "Hello World" Grammar

The following Lark grammar will match the string "Hello, World!" --

```lark
// A bunch of words
start: word+                

// Allow optional punctuation after each word
word: WORD ["," | "!"]

// imports WORD from library
%import common.WORD   

// Disregard spaces in text
%ignore " "           
```

### Syntax Highlighting

Lark provides syntax highlighting for its grammar files (\*.lark):

- [Sublime Text & TextMate](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark_syntax)
- [vscode](https://github.com/lark-parser/vscode-lark)
- [Intellij & PyCharm](https://github.com/lark-parser/intellij-syntax-highlighting)
- [Vim](https://github.com/lark-parser/vim-lark-syntax)
- [Atom](https://github.com/Alhadis/language-grammars)

### Live Port

Usually, ports from one language to another are at risk of falling out of sync as time goes on.

But Lark.js wasn't translated by hand -- 98% of the lines were transpiled directly from Lark's Python code!

That means that futures updates to Lark-Python (fixes, features, etc.) will automatically sync to Lark.js.
