However, there's one main limitation: [cross-environment usage is\nunsupported](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools#cross-environment-usage-of-requirementsinrequirementstxt-and-pip-compile).\n\n> As the resulting requirements.txt can differ for each environment, users must execute pip-compile on each Python\n> environment separately to generate a requirements.txt valid for each said environment.\n\n`pip-compile-cross-platform` is planned to act as a stand-in replacement for `pip-compile` that **can** produce a\nsingle, source-of-truth `requirements.txt` file that can be used in any target environment.\n\nNote that compatibility with `pip-compile` is still weak, and [help to improve the state of\ncompatibility would be much appreciated](https://gitlab.com/mitchhentges/pip-compile-cross-platform/-/issues/1).\n\n## How it works\n\nEnvironment-specific dependencies are defined using [environment markers](https://peps.python.org/pep-0496/).\n`pip-compile` processes environment markers up-front according to the current environment.\n[`poetry`](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry), **another** fantastic project, can export a `requirements.txt`\nfile while tracking the state of all environment markers.\n\nEssentially, `pip-compile-cross-platform` is a thin wrapper around `poetry` that mimicks the interface of `pip-compile`.\n",
