    BaseCurseInstance - Class all child instances must inherit!

    A curses instance is a class representing information from curseforge.
    This allows developers to work with this information in a connivent way.

    Some classes might even do operations on the data if needed,
    or might be able to fetch data themselves.

    We seek to standardize curseforge information,
    allowing developers to work with with only one packet type,
    regardless of backend/method/source of information.

    We also provide a field for supplying metadata about the instance.
    This can really be anything the backend thinks is helpful,
    although we recommend keeping it to connection details and statistics.

    Packets can also have the raw, unformatted data attached to them.
    This data is NOT standardized,
    meaning that the raw data will most likely be diffrent across diffrent handlers.
    Be aware, that handlers are under no obligation to attach raw data to the packet!

        * raw - Raw data from the backend(Does not have to be provided!)

    CurseCategory - Represents a category for a specific game. 

    A 'category' is a collection of addons for a specific game.
    Lets use Minecraft as an example, Minecraft has the following catagories:

        * Resource Packs
        * Modpacks
        * Mods
        * Worlds

    If you wanted to get info on a mod, then you would search in the 'Mods' category.
    This allows addons to be organized by type.

    This class contains identifying info on catagories,
    most important being the category ID,
    which is needed to search for projects in that specific category.

    Categories can be nested,
    meaning that each category can have a variable number of child categories.
    We contain references to the root_id, 
    which is the ID of the root category for all nested categories.
    The parent_id is the ID of the category one level up from ours.

    We contain the following parameters:

        * id - ID of the category
        * game_id - ID of the game this category is under
