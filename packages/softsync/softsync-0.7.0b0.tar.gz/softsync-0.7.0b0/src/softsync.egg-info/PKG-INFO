Description: 
        Softsync helps you create and manage symbolic links to real files.  But, rather than
        store the links as separate files, as with traditional symlinks (think: `ln -s source target`),
        the links are stored in a single manifest file, per directory.  These kinds of links
        are called "softlinks".
        
        Softsync comprises a small collection of commands.  The main one is the `cp` command.
        Use it to create new softlinks to real files (or other softlinks).  It can also be
        used to "materialise" softlinked files into copies of their real counterparts (in
        either real or symbolic link form).
        
        What's the point?  This utility may be of use for simulating the benefits of symbolic links
        where the underlying storage supports the concept of files and directories, but does not
        provide direct support for symbolic links.  A good example of this is Amazon's S3, which has
        no native method of storing a symbolic link to another object (and none of the many suggested
        workarounds to this are suitable for your use-case).
