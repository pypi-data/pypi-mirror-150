Hey This Is A Module For Python It Makes Easy To Do Some Animated Text first do: `import textio` textio has an alphs variable which has a list of alphabets to import use: `textio.alphs` and textio also has a `renderText()` function which is different from `print()` you are thinking what is different from `print()` ? because this function has animated text it uses 2 args 1 is `string` 2 is `writetime` you can put `writetime` 0.1 to 0.10 now don't think more about `writetime` put any number from this. then second function is `deleteText()` which will delete the `renderText()` you have written before it takes 1 arg `wait` which is how many seconds after it should delete the text thats the brief explaination of TextIO.""",
