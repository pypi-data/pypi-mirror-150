## Usage

... *under construction*

but in short: **look at** demo1.py as well as my_script.py in the "demo" folder. 
The demo1.py scripts imports and initiates the tomarkdown package to generate:

  - my_script.md
  - my_script.TopLevel.md
  - my_script.TopLevel.MidLevel.md
  - my_script.a_class_generator

for the documentation of my_script.py.
Finally the mkdocs.yml has been adjusted by hand to include the generated markdown scripts and then Mkdocs does its thing.
You can see the results for yourself here: [https://berlinade.gitlab.io/tomarkdown](https://berlinade.gitlab.io/tomarkdown)
