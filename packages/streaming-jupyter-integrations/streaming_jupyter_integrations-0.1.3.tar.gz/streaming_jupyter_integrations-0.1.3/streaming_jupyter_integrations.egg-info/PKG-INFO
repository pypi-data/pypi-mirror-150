        # Streaming Jupyter Integrations
        
        Streaming Jupyter Integrations project includes a set of magics for interactively running `Flink SQL`  jobs in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebooks
        
        In order to actually use these magics, you must install our PIP package:
        
        ```shell
        python3 -m pip install streaming-jupyter-integrations --extra-index-url https://__token__:<your_personal_token>@gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/32827938/packages/pypi/simple
        ```
        
        In local development, when streaming-jupyter-integrations repository is checkouted on local machine, you may install the most current version:
        
        ```shell
        python3 -m pip install -e .[tests]
        ```
        
        The last thing to do is to register in Jupyter with a running IPython in the first cell:
        
        ```python
        %load_ext streaming_jupyter_integrations.magics
        ```
