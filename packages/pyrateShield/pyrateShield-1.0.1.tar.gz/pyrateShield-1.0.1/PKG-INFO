# README #

Pyrateshield is a python application that performs radiation shielding 
calculations for nuclear medicine and radiology departments in hospitals.
The application has a user friendly graphical interface and no python coding 
or commandline intereactions are needed at all.

The application is intended to calculate the (necessaryradiation shielding in 
entire radiology and nuclear medicine departments. Nuclear Medicine sources, CT
sources and Xray sources can be defined and positioned on a floorplan in the GUI. 
Walls with a defined thickness and material can be drawn using the mouse.

The radiation dose rate can be visualized as heatmaps and (dose) isocontours 
on the floorplan. Critical points can be added to calculate the exact dose 
rate in specific points. Critical point results can be easily exported to Excel.

## What is this repository for? ###

(Medical) physicists and radiation protection officers who are working at a 
a nuclear medicine or radiology department in a hospital. 

## How do I get set up? ###

###Cross Platform

Use 'pip install pyrateshield' to install the package in a python environment of
your choice. Type 'pyrateshield' to start the application.

Python savy users can also install from our repository.

When using an anaconda environment and having spyder installed within that 
environment may cause issues with spyder. Best practice is not to install 
pyrateshield and spyder within the same anaconda environment.A workaround could 
be reinstalling pyqt5 after installing pyrateshield('pip install pyqt5==version', 
with version the required version by spyder). 


###Windows

For windows standalone executables are distributed as well. To obatain a 
standalone executable send an e-mail to the authors.
