# Pyrateshield 

Pyrateshield is a python application that performs radiation shielding 
calculations for nuclear medicine and radiology departments in hospitals.
The application has a user friendly graphical interface and no python coding 
or commandline intereactions are needed at all.

The application is intended to calculate the (necessaryradiation shielding in 
entire radiology and nuclear medicine departments. Nuclear Medicine sources, CT
sources and Xray sources can be defined and positioned on a floorplan in the GUI. 
Walls with a defined thickness and material can be drawn using the mouse.

The radiation dose rate can be visualized as heatmaps and (dose) isocontours 
on the floorplan. Critical points can be added to calculate the exact dose 
rate in specific points. Critical point results can be easily exported to Excel.

## Intended users 

(Medical) physicists and radiation protection officers who are working at a 
a nuclear medicine or radiology department in a hospital. 

## How to start pyateshield 


### Windows

For windows standalone executables are distributed. To obatain a 
standalone executable look in the Windows folder of the dropbox link below:

### Cross Platform

Use 'pip install pyrateshield' to install the package in a python environment of
your choice. Type 'pyrateshield' to start the application. Pyrateshield 
requires python version 3.8 or later.

Python savy users can also install directly from our repository.

When using an anaconda environment and having spyder installed within that 
environment may cause issues with spyder. Best practice is not to install 
pyrateshield and spyder within the same anaconda environment.A workaround could 
be reinstalling pyqt5 after installing pyrateshield('pip install pyqt5==version', 
with version the required version by spyder). 

### Examples

Pyrateshield projects can be saved as a .zip file. There are a few examples 
available on the repository. The example zip files can be directly downloaded
from the links below:

[small_project_example](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kohplxt1vntesdo/small_project_example.zip?dl=0)

[large_project_example](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wji0e6duwxipwor/large_project_example.zip?dl=0)


### Legacy

Older version of pyrateshield use .psp files to store projects. They can still 
be read by later version of pyrateshield and saved as the newer .zip files
