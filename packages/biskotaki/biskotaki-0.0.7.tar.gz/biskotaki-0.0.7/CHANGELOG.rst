Changelog
=========


0.7.0 (2022-05-11)
==================

Generate a new `biskotaki` Python Package Project, using the
`v0.10.0 Cookiecutter Python Package`_ project generator.

The project generation process used the `v.0.10.0 Template`_ and all required input
information was read from the `v0.10.0 biskotaki.yaml`_ configuration file.

From a developer's point of view, this release's code was produced as follows:

1. Run generator and replace all files in the local `biskotaki` repository checkout
2. Commit all the changes

For more, on the generator used, check the `documentation`, `repository`_ and `Template`_ links.

Generated Additions
-------------------

Enhance the CI config, by adding extra `checks` in the `Test Jobs` and
automating the `integration` with the `codecov.io` hosting service.

**Added checks**:

- Doing a 'Lint check' on the code
- Doing a 'Compliance check' of the resulting packaged distro against python best practices
- Gathering and sending the Test Suite results to the codecov.io service

**Code Coverage**:

Include `step` in all Test Jobs to gather and send Code Coverage data resulting from running
the Test Suite.

    `Codecov` is to Code Coverage, as `GA` is to Continuous Integration.

    Upon granting permission, `codecov` will start accepting the accumulated results (such as
    Code Coverage data) from all `Test Jobs` during a `build` and provide a web UI featuring
    interactive visualization of the python code and its `coverage` on user-defined granularity
    level, interactive charts of the `coverage` evolution and more.
