           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

⚡️在200M宽带中实测可以拉满网速

<div align="center"> <img src='https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/05/03/OANTvF.gif' style="border-radius: 8px"> </div>

## 特性 Features
高性能，高并发，Asynchronous everywhere，得益于Python对于协程的支持，以及现代 Async HTTP 框架 [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) ，和 [anyio](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) ：
* 媒体文件（音频/视频）分段异步下载，以及备选服务器的同时利用
* 视频的音画异步下载
* 视频之间乃至任务之间的异步下载
* 断点续传
* 用户可控的并发量设置
* 与高并发配合的很好的进度条
* HTTP/2协议支持
* 异步文件I/O和异步视频合成

## 依赖环境 Environment
1. pip安装（需要python3.8及以上）
```shell
pip install bilix
```
2. [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/contact.html#MailingLists) ：一个命令行视频工具，用于合成下载的音频和视频

    * macOS 下可以通过`brew install ffmpeg`进行安装。
    * Windows 下载请至官网 https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows ，安装好后需要配置环境变量。
    * 最终确保在命令行中可以调用`ffmpeg`命令即可。

## 快速上手 Quick Start
bilix提供了简单的命令行使用方式，打开终端开始下载吧～
### 批量下载
批量下载整部动漫，电视剧，电影，up投稿.....只需要把命令中的`url`替换成你要下载的系列中任意一个视频的网页链接。\
到 bilibili 上找一个来试试吧～，比如这个李宏毅老师的机器学习视频：[链接](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JE411g7XF)
```shell
bilix get_series 'url'
```
`bilix`会下载文件至命令行当前目录的`videos`文件夹中，默认自动创建。

💡提示：在zsh终端中可能要用`''`将url包住，其他终端暂未测试。
* 目前支持的类型
  * 投稿视频
  * 番剧
  * 电视剧
  * 纪录片
  * 电影

`get_series`很强大，会自动识别系列所有视频并下载，如果该系列只有一个视频（比如单p投稿）也是可以正常下载的。

💡什么是一个系列：比如一个多p投稿的所有p，一部动漫的所有集。

另外`get_series`支持集数选择参数`-p`，例如通过`-p 1 3`即可指定下载P1至P3的视频
### 单个下载
用户😨：我不想下载那么多，只想下载单个视频。没问题，试试这个，只需要提供那个视频的网页链接：
```shell
bilix get_video 'url'
```
### 下载音频
假设你喜欢音乐区，只想下载音频，那么可以使用可选参数`--only-audio`，例如下面是下载[A叔](https://space.bilibili.com/6075139)一个钢琴曲合集音频的例子
```shell
bilix get_series 'https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ts411D7mf' --only-audio
```

### 下载特定up主的投稿

假设你是一个嘉心糖，想要下载嘉然小姐最新投稿的100个视频，那么你可以使用命令：
```shell
bilix get_up '672328094' --num 100
```
`672328094`是up主的id，在up空间首页的url中就可以找到哦，例如： https://space.bilibili.com/672328094

### 下载分区视频
假设你喜欢看舞蹈区👍，想要下载最近30天播放量最高的20个超级敏感宅舞视频，那么你可以使用
```shell
bilix get_cate 宅舞 --keyword 超级敏感 --order click --num 20 --days 30
```
`get_cate`支持大部分分区，可以使用排序，关键词搜索等，详细请参考`bilix -h`或代码注释

### 下载收藏夹视频
如果你需要下载自己或者其他人收藏夹中的视频，你可以使用`get_favour`方法
```shell
bilix get_favour '1445680654' --num 20
```
`1445680654`是收藏夹id，如果要知道一个收藏夹的id是什么，最简单的办法是在b站网页左侧列表中点击切换到该收藏夹，然后浏览器的url就会出现该收藏夹的id，例如 https://space.bilibili.com/11499954/favlist?fid=1445680654 ，其中url中的`fid`就是收藏夹id。

### 下载合集或视频列表
如果你需要下载up主发布的合集或视频列表，你可以使用`get_collect`方法
```shell
bilix get_collect 'url'
```
将`url`替换为某个合集或视频列表详情页的url（例如[这个](https://space.bilibili.com/369750017/channel/collectiondetail?sid=630)）即可下载合集或列表内所有视频

💡合集和视频列表有什么区别？b站的合集可以订阅，列表则没有这个功能，但是他们都在up主空间页面的合集和列表菜单中，例如[这个](https://space.bilibili.com/369750017/channel/series)，`get_collect`则会根据详情页url中的信息判断这个链接是合集还是列表


### 下载字幕，弹幕，封面...
在命令中加入可选参数`--subtitle`（字幕） `--dm`（弹幕） `--image`（封面），即可下载这些附属文件
```shell
bilix get_series 'url' --subtitle --dm --image
```


## 进阶使用 Advance Guide
请使用`bilix -h`查看更多参数提示，包括方法名简写，视频画面质量选择，并发量控制，下载目录等。
### 你是大会员？🥸
请在`--cookie`参数中填写浏览器缓存的`SESSDATA`cookie，填写后可以下载需要大会员的视频。
### 在 python 中调用
觉得命令行太麻烦，不够强大？想要直接调用模块？下面是一个小例子。

```python
import asyncio
from bilix import Downloader


async def main():
    d = Downloader(video_concurrency=5, part_concurrency=10)
    cor1 = d.get_series(
        'https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ss28277?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0'
        , quality=999)
    cor2 = d.get_up_videos(mid='436482484')
    cor3 = d.get_video('https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ep477122?from_spmid=666.4.0.0')
    await asyncio.gather(cor1, cor2, cor3)
    await d.aclose()


asyncio.run(main())

```
`Downloader`类的下载方法都是异步的，例如`d.get_series(...)`返回的是一个协程`Coroutine`对象，我们可以自由组合这些方法的返回值，然后通过`await asyncio.gather`方法并发执行这些任务。例如上面的例子中我们同时执行了三种不同的任务。

你要组合很多很多任务？不用担心！`d`对象执行这些任务的并发度受到初始化参数的严格控制🫡，`video_concurrency`控制了同时下载的视频数量，而`part_concurrency`则控制了每个媒体文件（音频/画面）的分段并发数，如果你不太明白可以在代码和注释中找到他们的详细作用，或者就让他们保持默认吧。

### 关于断点重连
用户可以通过Ctrl+C中断任务，对于未完成的文件，重新执行命令会在之前的进度基础上下载，已完成的文件会进行跳过。但是对于未完成的文件，以下情况不能使用断点重连，建议清除未完成任务的临时文件再执行命令

- 中断后改变画面质量
- 中断后改变分段并发数`part_concurrency`

## 欢迎提问

### 已知的bug 🤡
* 出现未被正常捕捉的异常后断点重连可能导致视频画面或者音频部分缺失（例如突然拉闸😅）
* 不支持部分的没有音画分开下载方式的老视频
* 当两个视频名字完全一样时，任务冲突但不会报错，可能导致视频缺胳膊少腿
* 未知情况下出现无限下载[issue](https://github.com/HFrost0/bilix/issues/11)
