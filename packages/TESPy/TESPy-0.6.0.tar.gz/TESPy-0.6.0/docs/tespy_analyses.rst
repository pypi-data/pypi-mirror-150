Thermodynamic analyses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Performing thermodynamic cycle analyses making use of the second law of
thermodynamics provides further process information and uncovers potentials for
improvement in power plant engineering. Therefore, TESPy's analyses module
provides you with an inbuilt and fully automatic exergy analysis. Adding
entropy analysis is planned for the future.
