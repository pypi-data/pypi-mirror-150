This repository provides a toolbox for [siibra](https://siibra-python.readthedocs.io) which provides functionalities to assign neuroimaging signals to brain regions. It is inspired by similar functionalities of the popular [SPM anatomy toolbox](https://github.com/inm7/jubrain-anatomy-toolbox).

    **Note:** *``siibra-toolbox-neuroimaging`` is still in development. While care is taken that it works reliably, its API is not yet stable and you may still encounter bugs when using it.*


``siibra-python``\ ’s documentation is hosted at https://siibra-python.readthedocs.io. It includes a catalogue of well
documented code examples that walk you through the different concepts
and functionalities. As a new user, it is recommended to go through
these examples - they are easy and will quickly provide you with the
right code snippets that get you started. Furthermore, a set of jupyter
notebooks demonstrating concrete example usecases are maintained in the
`siibra-tutorials <https://github.com/FZJ-INM1-BDA/siibra-tutorials>`__
repository.
