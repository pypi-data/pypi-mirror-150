Hello there! This package has the goal of making it easy to simulate electrode recording, optogenetics, and real-time input and output processing with the Brian 2 spiking neural network simulator. While `cleosim` was created to facilitate prototyping closed-loop control experiments, we hope the electrode and optogenetics components will be useful outside this scope for the broader community of Brian users.

This package was developed by [Kyle Johnsen](https://kjohnsen.org) and Nathan Cruzado under the direction of [Chris Rozell](https://siplab.gatech.edu) at Georgia Institute of Technology.
