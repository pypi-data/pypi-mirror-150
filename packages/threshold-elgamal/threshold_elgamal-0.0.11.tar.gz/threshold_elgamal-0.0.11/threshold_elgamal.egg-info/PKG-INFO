Description: # Threshold ElGamal cryptosystem
        
        Library that provides functions for encryption, decrpytion and DKG algorithm using the ElGamal cryptosystem.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install threshold-elgamal
        ```
        
        ## Getting started
        The simplest way you can test out this library is by running its main function:
        
        ```python
        from threshold_elgamal import run_tc_scheme
        
        res = run_tc_scheme(3, 5, m=10)
        if res is True:
            print("Success!")
        ```
        
        You can also create your own threshold scheme manually, and then encrypt and decrypt a message of your choosing:
        ```python
        from threshold_elgamal import create_tc_scheme
        
        public_key, players, scheme = create_tc_scheme(3, 5)
        c1, c2 = scheme.encrypt(public_key, message=10)
        decryption_shares = {player.id: player.get_decryption_share(c1) for player in players}
        decrypted_msg = scheme.decrypt(c2, decryption_shares)
        
        if decrypted_msg == 10:
            print("Success!")
        ```
