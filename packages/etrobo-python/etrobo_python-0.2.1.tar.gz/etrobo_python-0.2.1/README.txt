Python middleware for ET-ROBOCON 2022.

This is a python middleware to develop embedded programs to control robots
at ETROBOCON 2022 (https://www.etrobo.jp/). Using this middleware, developers
can write python programs that run both in robots (ev3dev/raspike) and
simulator. See the following GitHub repository, if you would like to know more
about this middleware. (This repository supports only Japanese, and does not
have a planto support English).
