<p>This article describes the OpenSees implementation of a 1D
consolidation model. A single soil column is modeled in two-dimensions,
but all compression is one-dimensional. The model can consider either
single or double drainage of the soil layer.</p>
<p>The input file needed to execute this analysis, <a
href="1Dconsolidation.tcl" title="wikilink">1Dconsolidation.tcl</a>, is
provided along with several helpful <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a> scripts to plot the results,
plotPorePressure.m and plotStress.m.</p>
<p>Download them all in a compressed file: <a
href="Media:consolidation.zip"
title="wikilink">consolidation.zip</a></p>
<p>To run this example, the user must download the file <a
href="1Dconsolidation.tcl" title="wikilink">1Dconsolidation.tcl</a>.
Once this has been done, the user can then type "source
1Dconsolidation.tcl" into the interpreter of the OpenSees.exe
application to run the analysis. The Matlab scripts are not essential to
the analysis, however, they are provided to demonstrate how certain
plots can be obtained from the recorded output.</p>

</figure>
<p>The one-dimensional consolidation model consists of a column of
9-node quadrilateral elements. These elements have two sets of nodes;
the corner nodes have 3 degrees-of-freedom (2 displacement, 1 pore
pressure), and the interior nodes have 2 displacement degrees-of-freedom
only. These elements do not display the locking behavior associated with
4-node quadrilateral elements with pore pressure degrees-of-freedom,
though the connectivity becomes more complex. A schematic depicting the
1D consolidation model is provided in Fig. 1. In this diagram, the
corner nodes are blue and the interior nodes are red.</p>
<p>This example is able to consider both single and double drainage
conditions for the soil layer. The user can specify the desired drainage
condition using the variable &lt;tt&gt;drainage&lt;/tt&gt;. Setting
&lt;tt&gt;drainage&lt;/tt&gt; to 1 gives single drainage, with zero pore
pressure at the top of the soil layer. Setting
&lt;tt&gt;drainage&lt;/tt&gt; to 2 gives double drainage, with zero pore
pressure at the top and bottom of the soil layer.</p>
<h3 id="mesh_geometry">Mesh Geometry</h3>
<p>The geometry of the finite element mesh used for this example is
dependent on several parameters which must be specified by the user.
These include the number and size of the elements in the horizontal
direction (default values are 1.0) and the number and size of the
elements in the vertical direction. In this example, there are 10
elements in the vertical direction, and the elements are square.</p>
<h3 id="corner_nodes">Corner Nodes</h3>
<p>The corner nodes of the elements (depicted in blue in Fig. 1) are
created in two dimensions, with three degrees-of-freedom (DOF). The
first two DOF are displacements in the horizontal and vertical
directions. The third DOF is for pore pressure. The input file provided
with this example automatically generates the corner nodes in the proper
locations depending on the parameters defined in the mesh geometry
section.</p>
<p>All of the corner nodes are fixed against horizontal translation
(first DOF). The nodes on the lower boundary are fixed against both
horizontal and vertical translations.</p>
<p>The corner nodes at the upper boundary of the soil layer are fixed in
the pore pressure DOF for the single and double drainage cases, while
the corner nodes at the lower boundary are only fixed in the pore
pressure DOF for the double drainage case.</p>
<h3 id="interior_nodes">Interior Nodes</h3>
<p>The interior nodes of the elements (depicted in red in Fig. 1) are
created in two dimensions, with two DOF. The input file provided with
this example automatically generates these nodes in the proper locations
based on the specified parameters in the mesh geometry section.</p>
<p>The single interior node at the lower boundary is fixed against
horizontal and vertical translation. The interior nodes on the edges of
the soil column are fixed against horizontal displacements.</p>
<p>The nodes on the upper boundary of the soil layer (both corner and
interior) are given equal displacement DOF using the <a
href="equalDOF_command" title="wikilink">equalDOF command</a>.</p>
<h3 id="soil_material">Soil Material</h3>
<p>The soil in this example is assumed to be cohesive, therefore the
nDMaterial <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1558.htm">PressureIndependMultiYield</a>
is used for the soil constitutive model. The various required material
parameters (shear modulus, bulk modulus, permeability, etc...) are
defined for this constitutive model based upon the assumed soil type.
The cohesive soil is assumed to be homogenous within the soil layer,
therefore only a single material object is defined.</p>

<p>Nine-node quadrilateral elements are used to model the soil using the
<a href="Nine_Four_Node_Quad_u-p_Element" title="wikilink"> 9_4_QUadUP
element</a>. The connectivity for this type of element is depicted in
Fig. 2. The input file automatically generates the elements based on the
number of vertical elements specified in the mesh geometry section.

title="wikilink">Effective Stress Site Response Analysis of a Layered
Soil Column</a> example for further information on these elements.</p>
<h3 id="gravity_loading_and_analysis">Gravity Loading and Analysis</h3>
<p>The gravity analysis in this example is conducted as a <a
href="analysis_Command" title="wikilink">transient analysis</a> with
very large time steps, thus simulating a static analysis while avoiding
the conflicts which may occur when mixing static and transient analyses.
The self-weight of the soil elements provides the loads, therefore, no
loading object is required. Gravity is applied for ten steps with
entirely elastic constitutive behavior. This allows the material objects
to update various parameters to account for confining pressure. Once
these steps have converged, the material objects are updated using the
<a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1559.htm">updateMaterialStage
command</a> to consider elastoplastic behavior, and the gravity analysis
is repeated for 40 steps.</p>
<h3 id="recorders">Recorders</h3>
<p>The recorders are defined after the gravity analysis so the recorded
information only includes the post-gravity results. The <a
href="Recorder_Command" title="wikilink">recorders</a> defined for this
example document the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>the nodal displacements in the displacement DOF</li>
<li>the nodal velocities in the pore pressures DOF (records pore
pressure data)</li>
<li>the stress and strain response at the ninth Gauss point in each
element (at center of element)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="consolidation_loading_and_analysis">Consolidation Loading and
Analysis</h3>
<p>The consolidation loading comes from an surcharge load applied to the
center node a the upper boundary of the soil layer (see Fig. 1). This
load has a negative sign, and is applied in the vertical DOF, indicating
that it is applied in the downward direction. The surcharge load is
implemented using a <a href="Constant_TimeSeries" title="wikilink">
constant timeseries</a> and a <a href="Plain_Pattern" title="wikilink">
plain pattern</a>. It is important to note that this load is essentially
dropped onto the soil column instantaneously. To eliminate this from the
analysis, large Rayleigh damping parameters are used in order to damp
out the free vibration due to this shock loading.</p>
<p>The consolidation analysis is also conducted as a <a
href="analysis_Command" title="wikilink">transient analysis</a>, and is
analyzed for 800 steps with a time step of 0.25. The analysis is
conducted using the <a href="Newmark_Method" title="wikilink"> Newmark
integrator</a> using the same gamma and beta coefficients defined in the
gravity analysis. It may be necessary to vary the size of the time steps
and the corresponding number of steps when switching between the single
and double drainage cases.</p>

<p>Several plots displaying results obtained from running this example
analysis are provided for use as a means of verification and to
demonstrate the information which can be gained from this 1D
consolidation analysis. The distributions of pore pressure in the soil
layer are shown Figs. 3 and 4 for the single and double drainage
conditions, respectively. These figures show the initial distribution in
blue. As time increases, the distributions transition from green to red.
The final recorded time step is shown in black. For the single drainage
case, the pore pressures are shown, with the final step representing
hydrostatic pressure. For the double drainage case, excess pore pressure
is shown. These figures were generated using the Matlab script
plotPorePressure.m available for download in the compressed file at the
top of this article.</p>
<p>The distribution of vertical effective stress in the soil layer is
shown in Fig. 5 for the case of single drainage. The same color scheme
is used to indicate the passage of time. With increasing time and
decreasing excess pore pressure, the vertical stress distribution
approaches a linear variation dependent upon the soil unit weight. This
figure was generated using the Matlab script plotStress.m available for
download in the compressed file at the top of this article.</p>
<p>Fig. 6 shows the evolution of the settlement at the ground surface
for the single and double drainage conditions. As would be expected, the
settlement occurs more rapidly for the double drainage case. These
figures were generated by plotting the recorded vertical displacements
of the upper right node of the soil column at each time step.</p>
