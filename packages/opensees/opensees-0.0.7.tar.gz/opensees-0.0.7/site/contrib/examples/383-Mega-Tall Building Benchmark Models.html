<hr />
<p>Based on the refined ETABS Benchmark model of a mega-tall building
(provided by Prof. Xilin Lu and Prof. Huangjun Jiang from Tongji
University (Lu et al., 2015a)), the corresponding models of OpenSees are
established and provided here <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/examples/Model1.rar">1</a>.
The modeling method proposed by Lu et al. (2015b) is adopted for this
building. &lt;br&gt;</p>

<p>Two mesh schemes are considered, which results in two models: Model 1
and Model 2. Model 1 is relatively coarse, which has 27220 nodes. The
coupling beams and shear walls of Model 1 is subdivided to generate
Model 2, which has 81572 nodes.</p>
<p>The comparison with Etabs for Model 1 and Model 2 is as shown
below</p>

<p>&lt;br&gt; The shear walls and coupling beams are simulated using
ShellMITC4 in OpenSees. There are some differences in defining the
elastic modulus of concrete in ETABS and OpenSees, which will affect the
calculated vibration periods. When we conduct the modal analysis, the
elastic modulus of concrete material in OpenSees should be adjusted
following the equation Ec=2fc/0, where Ec is elastic modulus of
concrete in ETABS. Through the adjustment, the vibration periods of
OpenSees agree well with those of ETABS. Note that the commercial
software package MSC.Marc has been widely used in nonlinear analyses of
super-tall buildings and well validated. The corresponding models are
also established in MSC.Marc (denoted as Model1M and Model2M,
respectively). Through the comparison between the time history analysis
results of OpenSees and MSC.Marc, the reliability of the OpenSees models
is validated.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt; The El-Centro ground motion, which is scaled to a value of
PGA of 220 cm/s2 (i.e., the MCE level ground motion of this building
according to the Chinese code), is firstly used to conduct the time
history analysis of Model1 and Model1M. Note that both CPU and GPU
solvers (Tian et al. 2015) are used to perform the time history analysis
to validate the reliability and facilitate different researchers to use
these models. If you want to use the CPU version model, please use
“dynamiccpu.tcl”, else please use “dynamicgpu.tcl” in the zip files.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>The time history curves of the roof and the envelope of inter-story
drift are presented in Figure 2. Good agreements are observed. In
addition, the time history results obtained from CPU and GPU are also
compared in Figure 3. The results are identical, thus validating the
reliability of the GPU solver.</p>
<p>Then, the time history analysis of Model2 and Model2M are also
performed. The time history curves of the roof and the envelope of
inter-story drift are presented in Figure 4. Good agreements are also
observed, thus validating the reliability of Model2.</p>
<p>Note that we define several recorders. Among these, dispx.txt,
dispy.txt and dispz.txt record the translational displacements of all
nodes for post-process, which will consume considerable hardware
memories, so please use it with caution.</p>
