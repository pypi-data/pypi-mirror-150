# Truss Model Example - Mestyanek Squat Wall

<p>Example prepared by: <span style="color:blue"> Yuan Lu, UC
Berkeley </span> and <span style="color:blue"> Marios

<hr />
<p>This example describes the Opensees implementation of a nonlinear
truss model for a squat shear critical wall subject to static cyclic
loading. The response of Unit 1.0 from Mestyanek (1986) is studied in
this example and the experimental and computed response will be compared
in the results.</p>
