# Introduction To Tcl

<h3 id="commands">Commands</h3>
<p>Tcl is a string-based command language with relatively little syntax.
Tcl scripts are made up of commands separated by new lines or semicolon
(;). The basic syntax for a Tcl command is:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>command arg1 arg2 arg3 ...</strong></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>command</strong></p></td>
<td><p>is name of the command</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>$arg1 $arg2 $arg3 ...</strong></p></td>
<td><p>are the arguments for the command</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The command is either the name of a built-in command or a Tcl
procedure defined previously by the user. White space (i.e., space or
tab) is used to separate the command name and its arguments, and a
newline or semicolon is used to terminate a command. The arguments to a
command are just <strong>strings</strong>. Here is an example:</p>
<p>
```tcl
 puts "Hello World" 
```
</p>
<p>The <strong>puts</strong> is the command. In this example it takes
one argument. In this form puts will take the single string argument at
write it to the terminal. The quotation marks <strong>"</strong> are
used to group the words into a single argument, <strong>{ }</strong>
braces could also have been used. Tcl has syntax for grouping, which
allows multiple words in one argument, and substitution, which is used
with programming variables and nested command calls. The Tcl interpreter
does grouping first, then substitutions, and finally it calls the
command. It is up to the command to interpret its arguments.</p>
<h3 id="source_command">Source Command</h3>
<p>The interpreters allow you to enter commands one-by-one interactivily
at the <strong>OpenSees &gt;</strong> prompt. An important command for
OpenSees users is the <strong>source</strong> command. The source
command reads Tcl commands from a file and evaluates them just as if you
had typed them interactively. For example, if the file
<strong>hellloWorld.tcl</strong> contained the example puts command used
above, the user could cause the interpreter to execute this command by
invoking the following:</p>
<p>
```tcl
 source "helloWorld.tcl" 
```
</p>
<p>While not very useful for this example, for users creating finite
element models and analyzing them it is obviously very useful.</p>
<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
<p>Another basic command in tcl is the <strong>set</strong> command. It
is used to assign a value to a variable.</p>
<p>
```tcl
 set msg "Hello World" 
```
</p>
<p>In this example we are setting the variable <strong>msg'' to be equal
to the string</strong>Hello World<strong>. It is useful to note that a
number of predefined variables exist when you start an interpreter. For
those programmers who are reading this, the variables,</strong>argc
<strong>,</strong> argv <strong>, and</strong> env ''' (amongst others)
can be used in the script.</p>
<h3 id="command_substitution">Command Substitution</h3>
<p>Commands in tcl can be nested. A nested command is delimited by
square brackets, [ ]. The Tcl interpreter takes everything between the
brackets and evaluates it as a command. It rewrites the outer command by
replacing the square brackets and everything between them with the
result of the nested command.</p>
<p>
```tcl
 set msgLength [string length " Hello
World"] 
```
</p>
<h3 id="mathematical_expressions">Mathematical Expressions</h3>
<p>The Tcl interpreter itself does not evaluate math expressions.
Instead, the expr command is used to evaluate math expressions. The
interpreter treats expr just like any other command, and it leaves the
expression parsing up to the expr implementation. The math syntax
supported by expr is the same as the C expression syntax. The expr
command deals with integer, floating point, and boolean values. Logical
operations return either 0 (false) or 1 (true). The typical arithmetic
operators, <strong>+, -, *, /, %, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, ==, !=,
...</strong> and the typical mathematical functions <strong>sin(),
cos(), tan(), sqrt(), log(), log10(), pow(), rand(), srand(), exp(),
...</strong> found in many programming languages are available for use
in expressions.</p>
<p>
```tcl
 set a [expr 3 /2.0]</p>
<h1 id="set_pi_expr_2asin1.0">&gt; 1.5 set pi [expr 2*asin(1.0)]</h1>
<p>&gt; 3.14159.. 
```
</p>
<p>A word or warning, integer values are promoted to floating point
values as needed, WHICH MEANS THE USER MUST BE WARY OF INTEGER
DIVISION.</p>
<p>
```tcl
 set a [expr 3 /2.0] =&gt; 1.5 set b [expr
3/2]</p>
<h1 id="set_c_expr_3.02">&gt; 1 set c [expr 3.0/2]</h1>
<p>&gt; 1.5 
```
</p>
<h3 id="procedures">Procedures</h3>
<p>Tcl uses the proc command to define procedures. Once defined, a Tcl
procedure is used just like any of the built-in Tcl commands. The basic
syntax to define a procedure is:</p>

```tcl
proc $name $argsList $body
```
<p>The first argument, <code class="tcl-variable">name</code>, is the name of the
procedure being defined. The second argument,
<code class="tcl-variable">argsList</code>, is a list of parameters to the procedure.
The third argument, <code class="tcl-variable">body</code>, is a command body that is
one or more Tcl commands. Here is a simple example that will define a
procedure named <strong>sum</strong>, that will take 2 args and return
the sum of these args. That is followed by an example setting the value
of the variable <strong>c</strong> to be result of invoking the
procedure <strong>sum</strong> with the values <strong>3</strong> and
<strong>5</strong>.</p>
<p>
```tcl
 proc sum {a b} { return [expr $a + $b] }
set c [sum 3 5] =&gt; 8 
```
</p>
<h3 id="file_io">FILE I/O</h3>
<p>Like any programming language, Tcl allows files to be opened for both
reading and writing. The following is an example that will open the file
<strong>tmp.out</strong> and write the factorial for the vaues 1 through
10 to it:</p>
<p>
```tcl
 proc factorial {n} { set a 1; set product
$n; while {$a &lt; $n} { set product [expr $product * $a]; set a [expr
$a + 1]; # or incr a 1 } return $product }</p>
<p>set file1 [open tmp.out w]</p>
<p>for {set i 1} {$i &lt;= 10} {incr i 1} { puts $file1 "factorial $i =
[factorial $i]" }</p>
<p>close $file1 
```
