# Beam-truss Model Example - C-shaped RC Wall

<hr />
<p>This example describes the Opensees implementation of a nonlinear
beam-truss model for a RC wall with a C-shaped section subject to
multi-axial loading. The response of Wall TUB from Beyer et al. (2008)
is studied in this example and the experimental and computed response
will be compared in the results.</p>

<h2 id="model_description">Model Description</h2>
<p>Specimen TUB was a C-shape section wall with shear span (M/VL) = 2.8
in the E-W direction and 2.6 in the N-S direction, as shown in the
figure below. The total applied axial load was 780 kN at the centroid of
the section. One actuator was used in the E-W direction and two in the
N-S direction to apply the lateral load, and a collar was used at the
top of the wall for the loading.</p>
<p>For the corresponding beam-truss model, shown below, the vertical and
horizontal elements represent the respective reinforcing bars and their
surrounding concrete in the respective direction. The diagonal elements
(<strong><a href="Truss2_Element" title="wikilink">Truss2</a></strong>
Elements with <strong><a href="ConcretewBeta_Material"

node in the model. Details for the beam-truss model, material model
parameters, and analysis are presented in Lu and Panagiotou (2013).</p>

<p>The cyclic computed response in all directions considered was in very
good agreement with the experimentally measured for all cycles. In very
good agreement with the experimentally observed diagonal crushing, the
model computed crushing of the concrete the base at element e2, see the
above figure, in the segment of the wall parallel to the EW direction
during the sweep cycle of 3% peak drift ratio.</p>

contours for all cycles, can be found <strong><a
