# Time History Analysis of a 2D Elastic Cantilever Column

<p>Example Provided by: <span style="color:blue"> Vesna Terzic, UC
Berkeley</span></p>
<hr />
<p>This example demonstrates how to perform time history analysis of a
2D elastic reinforced concrete cantilever column with a gravity load
included in the analysis. The column will be exposed only to horizontal
component of ground motion. This example is a tutorial for the slightly
modified example Ex1a.Canti2D.EQ.tcl (given in the <a
href="Examples_Manual" title="wikilink">examples manual</a>) and is
intended to help OpenSees beginners get started. Geometry of the
cantilever column, node and element numbering are shown in the figure
below.</p>

on how to run this example (for Windows users)</h2>
<p>To execute this ananlysis in OpenSees the user has to download these
files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Media:Ex1a.Canti2D.EQ.modif.tcl"
title="wikilink">Ex1a.Canti2D.EQ.modif.tcl</a></li>
<li><a href="Media:A10000.tcl" title="wikilink">A10000.tcl</a>
(ground-motion file)</li>
</ul>
<p>Place Ex1a.Canti2D.EQ.tcl and A10000.tcl file in the same folder with
the OpenSees.exe. By double clicking on OpenSees.exe the OpenSees
interpreter will pop out. To run the analysis the user should type:
&lt;pre style="width:650px"&gt; source Ex1a.Canti2D.EQ.modif.tcl
&lt;/pre&gt; and hit enter.</p>
<h2 id="create_the_model">Create the model</h2>
<p>Before creating the model it is advised to call <a
href="Wipe_Command" title="wikilink">wipe</a> command to destroy all
previously constructed objects, i.e. all previously defined components
of the model, all previously defined components of the analysis and all
previously defined recorders.</p>
<p>The model of a structural system is created in the following way:</p>
<p>1. Spatial dimension of the model (NDM) and number of
degrees-of-freedom (DOF) at nodes are defined using <a
href="model_command" title="wikilink">model</a> command.</p>
<p>2. Coordinates of the nodes are defined using <a href="node_command"
title="wikilink">node</a> command. At this point the user has to choose
basic units (e.g., kip, in., sec) and remain consistent while creating
the model.</p>
<p>3. If dynamic (transient) analysis is performed nodal mass is
assigned using either <a href="node_command" title="wikilink">node</a>
or <a href="Mass_Command" title="wikilink">mass</a> command. A mass has
to be assigned to each degree of freedom.</p>
<p>4. The boundary conditions are defined using using single-point
constraint command <a href="fix_command" title="wikilink">fix</a>. For
nodes that have some fixity, constraints have to be defined at all
degrees of freedom (0 if unconstrained (or free), 1 if constrained (or
fixed)). Completely free nodes do not have to be defined.</p>
<p>5. Before element is defined, the geometric transformation of the
element has to be defined using <a
href="Geometric_Transformation_Command" title="wikilink">geometric
transformation</a> command. This command transforms beam element
stiffness and resisting force from the basic system to the
global-coordinate system. Three types of geometric transformation are
available in OpenSees: <a href="Linear_Transformation"
title="wikilink">Linear Transformation</a>, <a
href="PDelta_Transformation" title="wikilink">PDelta Transformation</a>,
and <a href="Corotational_Transformation" title="wikilink">Corotational
Transformation</a>. In a 2D problem, element orientation does not need
to be considered, and can be same for all elements.</p>
<p>6. The elements are to be defined using one of the elements available
in OpenSees. For the purpose of this example <a
href="Elastic_Beam_Column_Element" title="wikilink">Elastic Beam Column
Element</a> will be used. Different types of elements require different
additional commands for their definition.</p>
<p>For the given example, steps from 1 to 6 are explained below. The
link to command description is provided for each command so that a user
can see the definition of all the arguments that the command
invokes.</p>
<p>1. First we have to define the <a href="model_command"
title="wikilink">model</a> builder. The cantilever column is a 2D model
with 3 DOFs at each node. Thus, spatial dimension of the model (NDM) is
2 and number of degrees-of-freedom (ndf) is 3. This is defined in the
following way:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt; model
BasicBuilder -ndm 2 -ndf 3 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>2. The column has two nodes, labeled 1 and 2 (as shown in the Figure
above). Node 1 has coordinates (0,0) and node 2 has coordinates (0,432)
in the global coordinate system (x,y). The basic units chosen to build
the model are: kip, in, sec. Note: y coordinate for node 2 is 36*12=432
in.</p>
<p>Nodes are defined using the <a href="node_command"
title="wikilink">node</a> command: &lt;pre
style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt; node 1 0. 0. node
2 0. 432. &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>3. The cantilever column is constrained (fixed) at the node 1 in all
three DOFs (two translational and one rotation). This boundary condition
is defined with <a href="fix_command" title="wikilink">fix</a>
command.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt; fix 1 1
1 1 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>4. Mass is assigned at node 2 using <a href="Mass_Command"
title="wikilink">mass</a> command. Since transient analysis is going to
be performed for one component of ground motion (horizontal component -
x direction) the mass is to be assigned in x direction. The mass is
defined as Weight/g=2000/386=5.18. The vertical and rotational mass are
set to zero.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt; mass 2
5.18 0. 0. &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>5. The <a href="Geometric_Transformation_Command"
title="wikilink">geometric transformation</a> with id tag 1 is defined
to be linear.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt;
geomTransf Linear 1 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>6. The column is defined to be elastic using <a
href="Elastic_Beam_Column_Element"
title="wikilink">elasticBeamColumn</a> element. The element with the id
tag 1 will connect nodes 1 and 2. Cross-sectional area of the element is
(5*12)*(5*12)=3600in^2, Young's modulus of elasticity is
51000*sqrt(4000)/1000=3225 ksi (assuming fc'=4000 psi), and the moment
of inertia is (1/12)*(5*12)^4=1080000 in^4.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt; element
elasticBeamColumn 1 1 2 3600 3225 1080000 1 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<h2 id="define_recorders">Define recorders</h2>
<p>As a user you have an option of specifying the type of output that
will be created following the analysis. The OpenSees <a
href="Recorder_Command" title="wikilink">recorder command</a> is used to
define the analysis output. This command is used to generate a recorder
object for a specific type of response that is to be monitored during
the analysis and its output.</p>
<p>For the considered cantilever column, the displacements of free node,
support reactions, lateral drift, end element forces are recorded and
stored as text files in "Data" folder.</p>
<p>The <a href="Node_Recorder" title="wikilink">node recorder</a> is
used to output displacements of the free node (node 2) and support
reaction of the constrained node (node 1) into files DFree.out and
RBase.out, respectively. Both files will have a time stored in the first
column. The columns 2-4 of file DFree.out will contain displacements at
DOFs 1, 2, and 3. The columns 2-4 of file RBase.out will contain
reactions that correspond to DOFs 1, 2, and 3.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt;
recorder Node -file Data/DFree.out -time -node 2 -dof 1 2 3 disp
recorder Node -file Data/RBase.out -time -node 1 -dof 1 2 3 reaction
&lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The <a href="Drift_Recorder" title="wikilink">drift recorder</a> is
used to output lateral drifts into file Drift.out. The first column of
the file is the time, and the second column is the lateral drift
(relative displacements between nodes 1 and 2).</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt;
recorder Drift -file Data/Drift.out -time -iNode 1 -jNode 2 -dof 1
-perpDirn 2 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The <a href="Element_Recorder" title="wikilink">element recorder</a>
is used to output global forces of the column into file FCol.out. The
first column of the file is the time. The columns 2-7 of the file will
contain end node forces (shear, axial, and bending moment); 3 forces at
node 1 and 3 forces at node 2. These forces correspond to the global
coordinate axes orientation.</p>

<h2 id="how_to_apply_the_load_in_opensees">How to apply the load in
OpenSees?</h2>
<p>Applying load in OpenSees is a three-step process:</p>
<p>1. Loads are defined using <a href="Pattern_Command"
title="wikilink">pattern </a> command;</p>
<p>2. Analysis objects (constraint handler, DOF numberer, numerical
solver, type of test for convergence, solution algorithm, integrator,
and type of analysis to be performed) are defined next;</p>
<p>3. The loads are applied and the analysis is executed using <a
href="Analyze_Command" title="wikilink">analyze</a> command.</p>
<h2 id="gravity_load_analysis">Gravity load analysis</h2>
<p>In this example the gravity load is a substructure weight of 2000
kips. It will be applied at node 2 in 10 equal steps in increments of
200kips (0.1*2000). To apply the nodal load incrementally the <a
href="Linear_TimeSeries" title="wikilink">linear time series</a> with id
tag 1 will be used.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt;
timeSeries Linear 1 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The time series will be assigned to the <a href="Plain_Pattern"
title="wikilink">load pattern</a> with id tag 1. <a
href="NodalLoad_Command" title="wikilink"> Nodal load command</a> will
be used to create nodal load. It is a load at node 2 in negative Y
direction of 2000 kips. The load value is a reference load value, it is
the time series that provides the load factor. The load factor times the
reference value is the load that is actually applied to the node in one
time step of analysis.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt; pattern
Plain 1 1 { load 2 0. -2000. 0. } &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The analysis objects are defined next. To construct Constraint
Handler object the <a href="Constraints_Command"
title="wikilink">constraints</a> command is used. The Constraint Handler
object determines how the constraint equations (boundary conditions) are
enforced in the analysis. In the case of cantilever column with a total
fixity (all DOFs are constrained) at the node 1 <a
href="Plain_Constraints" title="wikilink">plain constraints</a> can be
used.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt;
constraints Plain &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>DOF Numberer object, that determines the numbering of degrees of
freedom (mapping between equation numbers and degrees-of-freedom) is
defined next. Since the model is very simple and small <a
href="Plain_Numberer" title="wikilink">plain numberer</a> will be
used:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt;
numberer Plain &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>To store and solve the system of equations during the analysis <a
href="BandGeneral_SOE" title="wikilink">BandGeneral</a> solver is
used:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt; system
BandGeneral &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>Since the column is elastic the system of equation can be solved in
one iteration. Thus, the <a href="Linear_Algorithm"
title="wikilink">linear algorithm</a> will be used to solve the system
of equations.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt;
algorithm Linear &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>Since the analysis is static and specific load (2000 kips) is to be
applied, <a href="Load_Control" title="wikilink">load control</a>
integrator will be used in this example. The load factor increment
($\lambda$ is set to 0.1 since the full load of
2000 kips is to be applied in 10 analysis steps. For the nth step of
analysis the load factor is $\lambda$n =
&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;n-1 +
 $\lambda$ .</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt;
integrator LoadControl 0.1 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The type of analysis is next defined using <a href="Analysis_Command"
title="wikilink">analysis</a> command. The gravity load is a static type
of the load and thus we have:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt;
analysis Static &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>With this all analysis objects are defined, so the analysis can be
performed. It is performed by invoking the command <a
href="Analyze_Command" title="wikilink">analyze</a> and by defining the
number of analysis steps to be performed (10 for this example).</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt; analyze
10 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>Since the transient analysis is going to be performed next, the
gravity load has to be maintained constant for the remainder of the
analysis and the time has to be restarted (set to 0.0) so that a time
for a new time history can start from 0.0. The <a
href="LoadConst_Command" title="wikilink">loadConst</a> command is used
for this.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt;
loadConst -time 0.0 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<h2 id="the_dynamic_ground_motion_analysis">The dynamic ground motion
analysis</h2>
<p>The load pattern for a time history analysis has to be defined first.
The load pattern consists of defining an acceleration record of a ground
motion that will be applied at the support (node 1). The ground motion
used for the analysis is acceleration record from Loma Prieta earthquake
(LOMAP) at station CDMG 58373 APEEL 10 - Skyline<a
href="http://peer.berkeley.edu/nga/data?doi=NGA0731">1</a> component
A10000. This acceleration record is provided at the beginning of this
tutorial. The time interval between the points found in the record (dt)
is 0.005 and number of data points found in the record (nPts) is 7990.
The <a href="Path_TimeSeries" title="wikilink">Path TimeSeries</a> with
id tag 2 is used to define the ground motion time series. The
acceleration time history of the recorded ground motion is in units of G
and it is thus factored with G = 386 in^2/sec.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt;
timeSeries Path 2 -dt 0.005 -filePath A10000.acc -factor $G
&lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The <a href="Uniform_Exciatation_Pattern" title="wikilink">uniform
exciatation pattern</a> with id tag 2 will be used to apply this time
series (with id tag 2) to a model in x direction (direction 1).</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt; pattern
UniformExcitation 2 1 -accel 2 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>Damping will be assigned to the model using <a
href="Rayleigh_Damping_Command" title="wikilink">rayleigh</a> command.
Rayleigh damping is mass and stiffness proportional. In OpenSees there
are three different stiffness matrices available for use: the current
stiffness matrix (at each iteration of a time step), the initial
stiffness matrix, and the committed stiffness matrix (at the last
committed step of analysis). For the linear elastic type of analysis the
three matrices are identical. In this example damping is specified to be
only stiffness proportional and equal to 2*(damping ratio)/(fundamental
frequency). The fundamental frequency is calculated from the first <a
href="Eigen_Command" title="wikilink">eigenvalue</a>. The damping ratio
is set to 0.02.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt; set
freq [expr [eigen -fullGenLapack 1]**0.5] set dampRatio 0.02 rayleigh 0.
0. 0. [expr 2*$dampRatio/$freq] &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The dynamic ground motion analysis is transient type of analysis and
therefore some of the analysis components have to be redefined. In order
to define new analysis objects the previously defined analysis objects
have to be destroyed. For this we will use wipeAnalysis command:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt;
wipeAnalysis &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The analysis objects that correspond to transient analysis are
defined next. Constraint handler, DOF numberer, numerical solver, and
algorithm will be the same as for the static (gravity) analysis.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt;
constraints Plain numberer Plain system BandGeneral algorithm Linear
&lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The integrator and the analysis type are different. Numerical
evaluation of the dynamic response will be performed using <a
href="Newmark_Method" title="wikilink">Newmark method</a> of
integration. The parameters $\gamma$ and
$\beta$ will be set to 0.5 and 0.25,
respectively. This choice of $\gamma$ and
$\beta$ leads to constant average acceleration
over a time step. The type of analysis is transient.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt;
integrator Newmark 0.5 0.25 analysis Transient &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>With this all analysis objects are defined, so the analysis can be
performed. It is performed by invoking the command <a
href="Analyze_Command" title="wikilink">analyze</a> and by defining the
number of analysis steps to be performed and by defining the analysis
increments. The number of analysis steps is set to 3995 (nPts/2) and the
analysis increment is set to 0.01 (2*dt). Thus every second point in the
record will be skipped during the analysis.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:650px"&gt; analyze
3995 0.01 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
