# Adding your own Code

<p>OpenSees is a widely used in both research and practice. OpenSees was
designed and developed as a research tool intended to allow developers
to quickly test new theories using the finite element method, whether
this be new material, element, algorithm, integrator, solver, .... One
advantage of OpenSees over other finite element applications is the ease
with which these new components can be added to the application so that
they may be tested and verified by the developers and then shared with
others. The intent of this seminar is to show just how EASY this can
really be.</p>
