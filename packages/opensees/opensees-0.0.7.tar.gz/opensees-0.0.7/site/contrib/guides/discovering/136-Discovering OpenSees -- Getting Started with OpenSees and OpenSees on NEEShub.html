# Discovering OpenSees -- Getting Started with OpenSees and OpenSees on NEEShub

<p>OpenSees is an open-source software framework for developing
applications to simulate the performance of structural and geotechnical
systems subjected to earthquakes. OpenSees interpreters (OpenSees.exe,
OpenSeesSP.exe, OpenSeesMP.exe) are extensions of the Tcl interpreters
(tclsh, wish) which have been extended to commands for finite element
analysis (modeling, analysis, output specification). Thus, to create the
model in OpenSees the user has to know the basics of Tcl programming
language.</p>
<p>This web-learning session is primarily designed for new or beginning
users to help them understand the structure of OpenSees framework,
introduce them to Tcl programming language, guide them through on-line
OpenSees learning resources, and demonstrate the process of creating a
simple model and running it using OpenSees. It covers the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction to OpenSees</li>
<li>Introduction to Tcl programming language</li>
<li>Demonstration of how to download OpenSees interpreter and install
Tcl</li>
<li>Demonstration of How to Use OpenSees on NEEShub</li>
<li>Discussion of OpenSees Resources (command manual, getting started
manual, examples manual, message board)</li>
<li>Example of how to create and run a small structure</li>
</ol>
