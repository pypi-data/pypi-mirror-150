<p>The seminar is being presented by Professor Asif Usmani from the BRE
Center for Fire Safety Engineering at the University of Edinburgh. The
seminar will present the new capabilities in OpenSees related to the
modeling of structures subjected to fire that Professor Usmani and his
group developed. The following topi cs will be discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Background material showing real world examples and experimental
tests</li>
<li>Behavior of materials at elevated temperatures</li>
<li>New OpenSees classes and commands</li>
<li>Examples</li>
<li>Summary and conclusions</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be time at the end of the seminar for questions.</p>
