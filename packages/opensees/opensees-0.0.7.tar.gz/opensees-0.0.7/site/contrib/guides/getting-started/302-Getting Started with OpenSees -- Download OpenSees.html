<p>At this page the user is required to download two files
OpenSees.X.X.X.exe and tcl/tk Y.Y.Y. This can be done by selecting
(clicking) on the links located in the box labeled DOWNLOAD Windows
Binaries.</p>
<p>The file downloaded by clicking on the OpenSees.X.X.X.exe link is a
zip file, from which the OpenSees.X.X.X.exe file can be extracted using
your favorite extractor. The user can place this executable anywhere
they wish. It is recommended to place it in a directory near where all
your scripts will be stored.</p>
<p>The file downloaded by clicking the tcl/tk Y.Y.Y link is an installer
for Tcl/Tk. By clicking on the file the user is brought through a series
of screens.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first screen shows the package information for Y.Y.Y.</li>
<li>The second screen has the license agreement, you must accept the
license to proceed with the installation.</li>
<li>The third screen specifies the installation mode and location.
<strong>Here the user must change the default installation location from
C:/Tcl to C:/Program Files/Tcl</strong> (there is a space between
Program and Files), as shown in the image below.</li>
</ul>
