# Getting Started with OpenSees -- Lateral Loads -- Cyclic Lateral Load

<p>The following commands assume that the example.tcl and the
gravityloads.tcl files have been run. The wipe command should be used at
the beginning of the input to clear any previous OpenSees-objects
definition:</p>
<p>
```Tcl
 wipe source example.tcl source
gravityloads.tcl 
```
</p>
<p>In this analysis, a lateral displacement cycle (positive and
negative) of a prescribed amplitude is imposed at the free nodes (3 and
4). The imposed displacements are applied using a displacement-control
integrator, where the load factors are scaled to reach the desired
displacement (compared to an imposed-displacement analysis). This method
is the most efficient when you have a non-strength-degrading system.</p>
<p>The first step is to define the load pattern. To do so, we create a
new load pattern (ID tag 3) for the lateral loads</p>
<p>
```Tcl
 pattern Plain 3 Linear { load 3 100.0 0.0
0.0 load 4 100.0 0.0 0.0 } 
```
 Most of the analysis features
that were defined in the gravity analysis are still valid since this
type of analysis is also static. The loads, however, are applied
differently. While gravity was applied as a load, using the LoadControl
integrator, the DisplacementControl integrator is used in this pushover.
Similarly, while in the pushover analysis a single load increment was
used, variable load increments are used to reverse the loading from
positive to negative, and back to positive.</p>
<p>The load is applied to node 3, in the direction of DOF 1, with a
displacement increment of 1 for the first rise to amplitude 1, -2 for
the reversal to amplitude -1, and again positive 1 for the reversal back
to amplitude zero:</p>
<p>
```Tcl
 integrator DisplacementControl 3 1 0.1
analyze 10 integrator DisplacementControl 3 1 -0.2 analyze 10 integrator
DisplacementControl 3 1 0.1 analyze 10 
```
 this can be put
into a foreach loop: 
```Tcl
 foreach Dincr {0.1 -0.2
0.1} { integrator DisplacementControl 3 1 $Dincr analyze 10 }

```
