# Reset Command

<p>This command is used to set the state of the domain to its original
state.</p>

```tcl
reset
```
<p>NOTE:</p>
<p>It iterates over all components of the domain telling them to set
their state back to the initial state. This is not always the same as
going back to the state of the model after initial model generation,
e.g. if elements have been removed.</p>
