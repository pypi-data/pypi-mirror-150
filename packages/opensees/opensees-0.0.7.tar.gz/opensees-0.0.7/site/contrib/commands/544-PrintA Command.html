# PrintA Command

<p>This command is used to print the current global system matrix. The
limitation of the command is that the system being used must be a <a
href="FullGeneral" title="wikilink">FullGeneral</a></p>

```tcl
printA &lt;-file $fileName&gt;
```
<hr />
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><code class="parameter-table-variable">fileName</code></p></td>
<td><p>(optional) name of file to which data will be sent. overwrites
existing file. default is to print to stderr)</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr />
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>The printA command can only be issued after an analyze command; it
will invoke formTangent() on the integrator and spits out the result of
theSOE-&gt;getA(). As a consequence, the output is either a transformed
K matrix or some transformed combination of K, C and M. what the
transformation is depends on the constraints and the constraint
handler;</p>
<p>As previously stated, the system used must be a FullGeneral.</p>
