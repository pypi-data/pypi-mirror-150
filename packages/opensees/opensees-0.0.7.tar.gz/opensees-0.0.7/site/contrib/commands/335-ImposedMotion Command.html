# ImposedMotion Command

<p>This command is used to construct an ImposedMotionSP constraint which
is used to enforce the response of a dof at a node in the model. The
response enforced at the node at any give time is obtained from the
GroundMotion object associated with the constraint.</p>

```tcl
imposedMotion $nodeTag $dirn
        $gMotionTag
```
