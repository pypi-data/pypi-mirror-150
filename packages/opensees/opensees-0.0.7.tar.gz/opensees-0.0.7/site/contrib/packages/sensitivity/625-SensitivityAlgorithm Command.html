# SensitivityAlgorithm Command

<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
The most general command is the following, which computes the response
sensitivity at each time/load step, after the response has converged.
</dd>
</dl>

```tcl
sensitivityAlgorithm -computeAtEachStep
```
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
In those cases in which the sensitivity computation does not need to be
performed at each step (e.g., for linear elastic systems : subjected to
static pushover analysis), the sensitivity computation may be performed
only at the time/load steps required by
</dd>
<dd>
user:
</dd>
</dl>

```tcl
sensitivityAlgorithm -computeByCommand
```
<hr />
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
However, before using the ‘-computeByCommand’ option, it is the user’s
responsibility to make sure that the response sensitivities computation
is not needed at each time/load step. For example, in case of
incremental nonlinear FE analysis or dynamic analysis, using the
‘-computeByCommand’ option will produce wrong sensitivity results.
