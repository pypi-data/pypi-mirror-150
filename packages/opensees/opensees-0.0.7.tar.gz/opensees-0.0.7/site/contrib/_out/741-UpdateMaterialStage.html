# UpdateMaterialStage

<p>This command is used to update a
<strong>PressureDependMultiYield</strong>,
<strong>PressureDependMultiYield02</strong>,
<strong>PressureIndependMultiYield</strong>, or
<strong>FluidSolidPorous</strong> material. To conduct a seismic
analysis, two stages should be followed. First, during the application
of gravity load (and static loads if any), set material stage to 0, and
material behavior is linear elastic (with Gr and Br as elastic moduli).
A <strong>FluidSolidPorous</strong> material does not contribute to the
material response if its stage is set to 0. After the application of
gravity load, set material stage to 1 or 2. In case of stage 2, all the
elastic material properties are then internally determined at the
current effective confinement, and remain constant thereafter. In the
subsequent dynamic (fast) loading phase(s), the deviatoric stress-strain
response is elastic-plastic (stage 1) or linear-elastic (stage 2), and
the volumetric response remains linear-elastic.</p>

<td><p>desired stage:&lt;br/&gt; 0 - linear elastic, &lt;br/&gt; 1 -

modulus and bulk modulus) as a function of initial effective
confinement.&lt;br/&gt;</p></td>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p>1) The <strong>updateMaterialStag</strong>e command cannot occur
until elements have been built.</p>
<p>2) By default, the <strong>updateMaterialStage</strong> command
starts at stage 0.</p>
