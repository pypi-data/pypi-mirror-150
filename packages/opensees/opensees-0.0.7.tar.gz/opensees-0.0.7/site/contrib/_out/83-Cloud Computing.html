# Cloud Computing

<p>Cloud Computing will allow you to use resources external to your
computer/device to run OpenSees simulations. The simulations are run on
compute resources remote from you. The interaction with the remote
resources is done over the internet, the 'cloud. Basically the internet
is used to transfer your data to remote processors, the applications
process the data on the remote processors, and you obtain the processed
data when done again over the internet.</p>
