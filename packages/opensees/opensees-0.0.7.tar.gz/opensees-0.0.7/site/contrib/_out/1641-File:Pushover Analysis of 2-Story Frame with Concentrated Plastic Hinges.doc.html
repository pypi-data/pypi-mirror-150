<hr />
<p>This example demonstrates how to perform a pushover (nonlinear
static) analysis in OpenSees using a 2-story, 1-bay steel moment
resisting frame. The nonlinear behavior is represented using the
concentrated plasticity concept with rotational springs. These
rotational springs follow a bilinear hysteretic response based on the
Modified Ibarra Krawinkler Deterioration Model (Ibarra et al. 2005,
Lignos and Krawinkler 2009, 2010). For this example, all modes of cyclic
deterioration are neglected. A leaning column carrying gravity loads is
linked to the frame to simulate P-Delta effects.</p>

<p>The 2-story, 1-bay steel moment resisting frame is modeled with <a
href="elastic_Beam_Column_Element" title="wikilink">elastic beam-column
elements</a> connected by <a href="zeroLength_Element"
title="wikilink">zeroLength elements</a> which serve as rotational
springs to represent the structure’s nonlinear behavior. The springs
follow a bilinear hysteretic response based on the Modified Ibarra
Krawinkler Deterioration Model which will be described in more detail
later. A leaning column with gravity loads is linked to the frame by <a
href="Truss_Element" title="wikilink">truss elements</a> to simulate
P-Delta effects. An idealized schematic of the model is presented in
Figure 1. To simplify this model, panel zone contributions are neglected
and plastic hinges form at the beam-column joints, i.e., centerline
dimensions are used. Subsequent examples will explicitly model the panel
zone shear distortions and include reduced beam sections (RBS).</p>
<p>The units of the model are kips, inches, and seconds.</p>
<h3 id="basic_geometry">Basic Geometry</h3>
<p>The basic geometry of the frame is defined by input variables for the
bay width, height of the first story, and height of a typical (i.e. not
the first) story. These values are set as WBay = 360”, HStory1 = 180”,
and HStoryTyp = 144”. The leaning column line is located one bay width
away from the frame. In addition to the nine beam-column joint nodes,
there is one additional node for each spring, which connects the spring
to the elastic element. This makes a total of 24 nodes in the
structure.</p>
<h3 id="leaning_columns_and_frame_links">Leaning Columns and Frame
Links</h3>
<p>The leaning columns are modeled as <a
href="Elastic_Beam_Column_Element" title="wikilink">elastic beam-column
elements</a>. These columns have moments of inertia and areas about two
orders of magnitude larger than the frame columns in order to represent
aggregate effect of all the gravity columns (Aleaning column = 1,000.0
in2 and Ileaning column = 100,000.0 in4. The columns are connected to
the beam-column joint by <a href="zeroLength_Element"
title="wikilink">zeroLength</a> rotational spring elements with very
small stiffness values so that the columns do not attract significant
moments. These springs are created using <a href="rotLeaningCol.tcl"
title="wikilink">rotLeaningCol.tcl</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Truss_Element" title="wikilink">Truss elements</a> are used
to link the frame and leaning columns and transfer the P-Delta effect.
The trusses have areas about two orders of magnitude larger than the
frame beams in order to represent aggregate effect of all the gravity
beams (Atruss = 1,000.0 in2) and can be assumed to be axially rigid.</p>
<h3
id="rotational_springs_and_the_modified_ibarra_krawinkler_deterioration_model">Rotational
Springs and the Modified Ibarra Krawinkler Deterioration Model</h3>
<p>The rotational springs capture the nonlinear behavior of the frame.
As previously mentioned, the springs in the example employ a bilinear
hysteretic response based on the Modified Ibarra Krawinkler
Deterioration Model. Detailed information about this model and the modes
of deterioration it simulates can be found in Ibarra et al. (2005) and
Lignos and Krawinkler (2009, 2010).</p>
<p>In this example, the <a href="zeroLength_Element"
title="wikilink">zeroLength</a> spring elements connect the elastic
frame elements to the beam-column joint nodes. The springs are created
using <a href="rotSpring2DModIKModel.tcl"
title="wikilink">rotSpring2DModIKModel.tcl</a>. The input parameters for
the springs’ behavior are determined using empirical relationships
developed by Lignos and Krawinkler (2010) which are derived from an
extensive database of steel component tests. Alternatively, these input
parameters can be determined using approaches similar to those described
in FEMA 356 (http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1427), ATC-72
and ATC-76
(http://www.atcouncil.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=45&amp;Itemid=54).
In order to simplify the model and compare with SAP2000, cyclic
deterioration was ignored. This was accomplished by setting all of the
“L” deterioration parameter variables to 1000.0, all of the “c” exponent
variables to 1.0, and both “D” rate of cyclic deterioration variables to
1.0.</p>
<h3
id="stiffness_modifications_to_elastic_frame_elements_and_rotational_springs">Stiffness
Modifications to Elastic Frame Elements and Rotational Springs</h3>
<p>Since a frame member is modeled as an elastic element connected in
series with rotational springs at either end, the stiffness of these
components must be modified so that the equivalent stiffness of this
assembly is equivalent to the stiffness of the actual frame member.
Using the approach described in Appendix B of Ibarra and Krawinkler
(2005), the rotational springs are made “n” times stiffer than the
rotational stiffness of the elastic element in order to avoid numerical
problems and allow all damping to be assigned to the elastic element. To
ensure the equivalent stiffness of the assembly is equal to the
stiffness of the actual frame member, the stiffness of the elastic
element must be “(n+1)/n” times greater than the stiffness of the actual
frame member. In this example, this is accomplished by making the
elastic element’s moment of inertia “(n+1)/n” times greater than the
actual frame member’s moment of inertia.</p>
<p>In order to make the nonlinear behavior of the assembly match that of
the actual frame member, the strain hardening coefficient (the ratio of
post-yield stiffness to elastic stiffness) of the spring must be
modified. If the strain hardening coefficient of the actual frame member
is denoted αs,mem and the strain hardening coefficient of the spring is
denoted αs,spring then αs,spring = αs,mem / (1 + n*(1 - αs,mem))</p>
<p>Note that this is a corrected version of Equation B.5 from Ibarra and
Krawinkler (2005).</p>
<h3 id="constraints">Constraints</h3>
<p>The frame columns are fixed at the base, and the leaning column is
pinned at the base. To simulate a rigid diaphragm, the horizontal
displacements of all nodes in a given floor are constrained to the
leftmost beam-column joint node using the <a href="EqualDOF_command"
title="wikilink">equalDOF</a> command.</p>
<h3 id="masses">Masses</h3>
<p>The mass is concentrated at the beam-column joints of the frame, and
each floor mass is distributed equally among the frame nodes. The mass
is assigned using the <a href="node_command" title="wikilink">node</a>
command, but could also be assigned with the <a href="Mass_Command"
title="wikilink">mass</a> command.</p>
<h3 id="loading">Loading</h3>
<p>Gravity loads are assigned to the beam-column joint nodes. Gravity
loads tributary to the frame members are assigned to the frame nodes
while the remaining gravity loads are applied to the leaning columns.
The gravity loads are applied as a <a href="Constant_TimeSeries"
title="wikilink">constant time series</a> load pattern since the gravity
loads always act on the structure.</p>
<p>In this example, lateral loads are distributed in proportion each
floor’s weight and elevation. Lateral loads are applied to all the frame
nodes in a given floor. A <a href="Linear_TimeSeries"
title="wikilink">linear time series</a> pattern is used for lateral load
application so that loads increase with time.</p>
<h3 id="recorders">Recorders</h3>
<p>The <a href="Recorder_Command" title="wikilink">recorders</a> used in
this example include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="Drift_Recorder" title="wikilink">drift recorder</a> to
track the story and roof drift histories</li>
<li>The <a href="Node_Recorder" title="wikilink">node recorder</a> to
track the shear force reaction histories at the supports</li>
<li>The <a href="Element_Recorder" title="wikilink">element recorder</a>
to track the moment and rotation histories of the springs</li>
</ul>
<p>For the <a href="Element_Recorder" title="wikilink">element
recorder</a>, the <a href="Region_Command" title="wikilink">region
command</a> was used to assign all column springs to one group and all
beam springs to a separate group.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the recorders only record information
for <a href="Analyze_Command" title="wikilink">analyze commands</a> that
are called after the <a href="Recorder_Command"
title="wikilink">recorder commands</a> are called. In this example, the
recorders are placed after the gravity analysis so that the steps of the
gravity analysis do not appear in the output files.</p>
<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>The structure is first analyzed under gravity loads before the
pushover analysis is conducted. The gravity loads are applied using a <a
href="Load_Control" title="wikilink">load-controlled</a> static analysis
with 10 steps. After this analysis is completed, the time is reset to
zero so that the pushover starts from time zero. This is accomplished
with the <a href="LoadConst_Command" title="wikilink">loadConst
command</a>.</p>
<p>The pushover analysis is performed using a <a
href="Displacement_Control" title="wikilink">displacement-controlled</a>
static analysis. In this example, the structure was pushed to 10% roof
drift, or 32.4”. The roof node at Pier 1, node 13 in Figure 1, was
chosen as the control node where the displacement was monitored.
Incremental displacement steps of 0.01” were used. This step size was
used because it is small enough to capture the progression of hinge
formation and generate a smooth backbone curve, but not too small that
it makes the analysis time unreasonable.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>The results of the pushover analysis are shown in Figure 2, along
with results from a model built and analyzed in SAP2000. This figure
shows the normalized base shear (weight of the structure divided by the
base shear) versus the roof drift (roof displacement divided by the roof
elevation).</p>
