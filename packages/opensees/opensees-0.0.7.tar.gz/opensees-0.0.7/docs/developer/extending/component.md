# Compiling

Inside each module-level `CMakeLists.txt` file there is a function call
with the form:

``` cmake
target_sources(OPS_Module 
  PRIVATE 
    <some source files>...
  PUBLIC
    <some header files>...
)
```

Simple materials and elements can be added to the CMake build simply by
including them in the relevant CMake `target_sources` call.

For example, a new element might be implemented in a file called
`ElasticFoo.cpp` with header `ElasticFoo.h` in the directory
`OpenSees/SRC/element/`. These files would simply need to be added to
the function call `target_sources(OPS_Element ...)` in the file
`OpenSees/SRC/element/CMakeLists.txt`.
