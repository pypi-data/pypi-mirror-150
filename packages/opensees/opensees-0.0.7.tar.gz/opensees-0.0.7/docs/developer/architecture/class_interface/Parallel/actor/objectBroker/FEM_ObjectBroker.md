class FEM_ObjectBroker\

\

FEM_ObjectBrokers is an object used to create a new blank of a certain
type in a process. The explicit type of object created depends on the
method invoked and the integer *classTag* passed as an argument to the
method. Once the object has been created, `recvSelf()` can be invoked on
the object to instantiate the object with it's data.
