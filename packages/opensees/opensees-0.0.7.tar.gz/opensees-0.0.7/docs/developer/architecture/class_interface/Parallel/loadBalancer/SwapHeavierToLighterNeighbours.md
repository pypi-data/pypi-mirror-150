LoadBalancer\


A SwapHeavierToLighterNeighbours is an object used to balance a
PartitionedDomain. It does this by shedding the boundary vertices on the
heaviest loaded partition (subdomain).

// Public Methods\

\

\
Sets *numRealeases* to $1$ and *factorGreater* to $1.0$. These are the
paramemeters used in the `balance()` method.

Sets the parameters used in the `balance()` method.

\
Does nothing.

\
For *numRelease* times the Vertices of *theWeightedGraph* are iterated
through. For each Vertex, $i$, the weight of the Vertex is compared to
those of it's adjacent Vertices, $other$, (this is done by looping
through the adjacency ID of the Vertex), if the vertex weight is
*factorGreater* times greater than the other Vertices load then
*swapBoundary(i, other)* is invoked on the DomainPartitioner. Returns
$0$ if successful, otherwise a negative number and a warning message are
returned if either no link has been set to the DomainPartitioner or
`swapBoundary()` returns a negative number.
