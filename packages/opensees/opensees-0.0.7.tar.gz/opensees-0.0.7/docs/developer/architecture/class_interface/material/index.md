# Material Classes

Material classes are used to provide information to the Elements about
the material. There is one main class MaterialModel. The Element objects
query the MaterialModel objects to obtain the current value of stress
and the tangent defining the stress-strain relationship for the current
value of strain at the point in the domain represented by the
MaterialModel object.
