`BandGenLinSolver` is an abstract class. The BandGenLinSolver class
provides access for each subclass to the BandGenLinSOE object through
the pointer `theSOE`, which is a protected pointer.

### Constructor


### Destructor


// Public Methods



The integer `classTag` is passed to the LinearSOESolver classes
constructor.

\
Does nothing, provided so the subclasses destructor will be called.

```cpp
virtual int setLinearSOE(BandGenLinSOE &theSOE);
```
The method sets up the link between the BandGenLinSOE object and the
BandGenLinSolver, that it is sets the pointer the subclasses use.
