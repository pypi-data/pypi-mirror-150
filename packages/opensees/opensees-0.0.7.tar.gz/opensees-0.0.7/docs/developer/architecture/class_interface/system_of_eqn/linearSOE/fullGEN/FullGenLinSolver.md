LinearSOESolver\

\
FullGenLinSolver is an abstract class. The FullGEnLinSolver class
provides access for each subclass to the FullGenLinSOE object through
the pointer *theSOE*, which is a protected pointer.

### Constructor

### Destructor

\
// Public Methods\

\

The integer *classTag* is passed to the LinearSOESolver classes
constructor.

\
Does nothing, provided so the subclasses destructor will be called.

\
Sets the link to the FullGEnLinSOE object *theSOE*. This is the object
on which the solver will perform the numerical computations.
