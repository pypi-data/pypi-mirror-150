class Shadow\

\

Shadow is meant as an abstract class, i.e. no instances of Shadow should
exist. A Shadow object is associated with an Actor object which may
exist in another process. The Shadow acts like a normal object in the
users address space, data and processing that is done by the Shadow may
be stored and processed in a remote process, the Actor object resides in
this remote address space. The Actor and the Shadow both have a Channel,
a communication port. This allows the two to communicate with each
other.

This constructor is used when the actor process is already up and
running. The constructor sets its channel to be *theChannel*, its
associated object broker to be *theBroker*, and the address to which it
will send data to be *thaActorsAddress*.

This constructor is used to get an actor process up and running. If
*startShadow* is *true*, the constructor invokes
*startActor(program,theChannel,compDemand)* on *theMachineBroker*
object. It then invokes `setUpShadow()` on *theChannel* and
`getLastSendersAddress()` on *theChannel* to set up store the address of
the actors channel, *theActorsAddress*; this is done in case multiple
shadow objects use a single channel. If an error occurs an error message
is printed and the program terminated.

A method which will send the MovableObject *theObject* to the actor
object through the shadows channel. It returns the result of invoking
*sendObj(0,0,theObject, theBroker, theActorsAddress)* on the shadow's
associated channel *theChannel*.

```{.cpp}
virtual void recvObject(MovableObject &theObject);
```

A method which will cause the object to read the MovableObject
*theObject* from the channel. It will return the result of invoking
*recvObj(0,0,theObject, theBroker, theActorsAddress)* on the shadows
associated channel *theChannel*.

A method which will send the message *theMessage* to the actor object
through the shadows channel. It will return the result of invoking
*sendMsg(0,0,theMessage, theActorsAddress)* on the shadows associated
channel *theChannel*.

```{.cpp}
virtual void recvMessage(Message &theMessage);
```

A method which will cause the object to read the message *theMessage*
from the channel. It will return the result of invoking
*recvMsg(0,0,theMessage, theActorsAddress)* on the shadows associated
channel *theChannel*.

A method which will send the Matrix *theMatrix* to the actor object
through the shadows channel. It will return the result of invoking
*sendMatrix(0,0,theMatrix, theActorsAddress)* on the shadows associated
channel *theChannel*.

```{.cpp}
virtual void recvMatrix(Matrix &theMatrix);
```

A method which will cause the object to read the Matrix *theMatrix* from
the channel. It will return the result of invoking
*recvMatrix(0,0,theMatrix, theActorsAddress)* on the shadows associated
channel *theChannel*.

A method which will send the Vector *theVector* to the actor object
through the shadows channel. It will return the result of invoking
*sendVector(0,0,theVector, theActorsAddress)* on the shadows associated
channel *theChannel*.

```{.cpp}
virtual void recvVector(Vector &theVector);
```

A method which will cause the object to read the Vector *theVector* from
the channel. It will return the result of invoking
*recvVector(0,0,theVector, theActorsAddress)* on the shadows associated
channel *theChannel*.

A method which will send the ID *theID* to the actor object through the
shadows channel. It will return the result of invoking
*sendID(0,0,theID, theActorsAddress)* on the shadows associated channel
*theChannel*.

```{.cpp}
virtual void recvID(ID &theID);
```

A method which will cause the object to read the ID *theID* from the
channel. It will return the result of invoking *recvID(0,0,theID,
theActorsAddress)* on the shadows associated channel *theChannel*.

```{.cpp}
void Channel \*getChannelPtr(void) const;
```

A method which returns a pointer to the channel currently set.

```{.cpp}
void FEM_ObjectBroker \*getObjectBrokerPtr(void) const;
```

A method which returns a pointer to the FEM_ObjectBroker passed in the
constructor.

```{.cpp}
void ObjectBroker \*getActorAddressPtr(void) const;
```

A method which returns a pointer to the channel in the actors address
space.
