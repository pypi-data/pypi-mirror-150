# TransientAnalysis 

```cpp
#include <analysis/analysis/TransientAnalysis.h>

class TransientAnalysis:
public Analysis;
```

The `TransientAnalysis` class is an abstract class. Its purpose is to
define the interface common among all subclasses. A `TransientAnalysis`
object is responsible for performing a transient analysis on the
domain.

### Constructor

### Destructor


// Public Methods



// Protected Data



The Domain *theDomain* is passed to the Analysis classes constructor.
Sets the starting time and finishing time for the transient analysis to
*tStart* and *tFinish*.


Does nothing.


Invoked to perform a dynamic analysis on the model. The type of analysis
performed, depends on the type of the objects in the analysis
aggregation. Returns a $0$ if successful, otherwise a negative number is
returned; the value of which depends on the type of the analysis.

```{.cpp}
virtual void setTimeStart(double tStart);
```

To set the starting time of the TransientAnalysis to *tStart*. It
invokes `setCurrntTime(tStart)` on the associated domain object.

```{.cpp}
virtual void setTimeFinish(double tFinish);
```

To set the finishing time of the TransientAnalysis to *tFinish*.
