class LinearSOESolver: public Solver\

MovableObject\
Solver\

\
LinearSOESolver is an abstract class. A LinearSOESolver object is
responsible for solving the LinearSOE object that it is associated with.
That is, to find $x$ such that the matrix equation $Ax=b$ is satisfied.

\
The integer *classTag* is passed to the Solver.

\
Does nothing. Provided so the subclasses destructor will be called.

\
Causes the LinearSOESolver to solve the system of equations $Ax=b$ for
$x$. Returns $0$ if successful , negative number if not; the actual
value depending on the type of LinearSOESolver. The result of the solve
are to be stored in the $x$ vector of the LinearSOE by the object.

This is invoked by the *LinearSOE* object when `setSize()` has been
invoked on it. Solvers may sometimes need to store additional data that
needs to be updated if the size of the system of equation changes.
