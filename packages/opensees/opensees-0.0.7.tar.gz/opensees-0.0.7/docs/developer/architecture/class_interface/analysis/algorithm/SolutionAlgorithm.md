# SolutionAlgorithm 

```cpp
#include <analysis/algorithm/SolutionAlgorithm.h>

class SolutionAlgorithm: public MovableObject
```

The `SolutionAlgorithm` class is an abstract base class. Its purpose is to
define the interface common among all its subclasses. A
`SolutionAlgorithm` object performs the steps in the analysis by
specifying the sequence of operations to be performed by members in the
analysis aggregation.

### Constructor


### Destructor


// Public Methods\

\

\

\
The integer *classTag* is passed to the MovableObject classes
constructor.


Invokes the destructor on any recorder object added to the
SolutionAlgorithm and releases memory used to hold pointers to the
recorder objects.


Is called by the [`Analysis`](../analysis/Analysis) if the domain changes. It is called after
`domainChange()` has been called on the `ConstraintHandler`, `DOF_Numberer`
and the `Integrator` and after `setSize()` has been called on the
SystemOfEqn object. For base class nothing is done and $0$ is returned.
The subclasses can provide their own implementation of this method if
anything needs to be done, e.g. memory allocation, To return $0$ if
successful, a negative number if not.

To add a recorder object *theRecorder* to the SolutionAlgorithm. returns
$0$ if successful, a warning message and a $-1$ is returned if not
enough memory is available.

To invoke `record(track)` on any Recorder objects which have been added
to the `SolutionAlgorithm`.

To invoke `playback(track)` on any Recorder objects which have been
added to the `SolutionAlgorithm`.
