A `ProfileSPDLinDirectSolver` object can be constructed to solve a
ProfileSPDLinSOE object. It does this by direct means, using the $LDL^t$
variation of the cholesky factorization. The matrx $A$ is factored one
column at a time using a left-looking approach. No BLAS or LAPACK
routines are called for the factorization or subsequent substitution.

\
A unique class tag (defined in  `<classTags.h>`) is passed to the
ProfileSPDLinSolver constructor.

Does nothing.

\
The solver first copies the B vector into X. FILL IN The solve process
changes $A$ and $X$.
