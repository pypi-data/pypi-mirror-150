class Message\

\

Messages are objects that can be sent between Channels. They are
provided to allow data of arbitrary length and type, e.g. structs, to be
sent between processes running on similar machine architectures. WARNING
Sending Messages between machines with different architectures can
result in erroniuos data being received. Each Message object keeps a
pointer to the data it represents and an integer outlining the data
size. There is no copy of the data kept by the Message.

not. The routine `bcopy()` is used to copy the data.
