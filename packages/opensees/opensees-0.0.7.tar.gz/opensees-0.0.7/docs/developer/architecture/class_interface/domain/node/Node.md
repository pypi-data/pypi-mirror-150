Nodes are points in space connected by the elements. Nodes have original
position, trial displacement, velocity and acceleration, and committed
displacement, velocity and acceleration (the last committed trial
quantities). Nodes also store information about any load acting on the
node, nodal mass and the nodal participation matrix. In addition, each
Node object keeps track of it's associated `DOF_Group` object. The Node
interface provides methods to set and retrieve these quantities.

To construct a node which has no data, other than the *classTag*
identifier; $0$ and *classTag* are passed to the DomainComponent
constructor. This is the constructor called by an FEM_ObjectBroker. The
data must be filled in subsequently by a call to `recvSelf()`.

To construct a node whose unique integer among nodes in the domain is
given by *tag* and whose classTag is given by *classTag*. This
constructor can be used by subclasses who wish to handle their own data
management.

To construct a node for 1d problems whose unique integer among nodes in
the domain is given by *tag* and whose original position in 1d space is
given by (Crd1). With the node is associated *ndof* number of degrees of
freedom. The class tag is NOD_TAG_Node (defined in classTags.h). A
Vector object is created to hold the coordinates. No storage objects are
created to hold the trial and committed response quantities, mass, load
quantities; these are created as needed to reduce the memory demands on
the system in certain situations.

To construct a node for 2d problems whose unique integer among nodes in
the domain is given by *tag* and whose original position in 2d space is
given by (Crd1,Crd2). With the node is associated *ndof* number of
degrees of freedom. The class tag is NOD_TAG_Node. A Vector object is
created to hold the coordinates. No storage objects are created to hold
the trial and committed response quantities, mass, load quantities;
these are created as needed to reduce the memory demands on the system
in certain situations.

To construct a node for 3d problems whose unique integer among nodes in
the domain is given by *tag* and whose original position in 3d space is
given by (Crd1,Crd2,Crd3). With the node is associated *ndof* number of
degrees of freedom. The class tag is NOD_TAG_Node. A Vector object is
created to hold the coordinates. No storage objects are created to hold
the trial and committed response quantities, mass, load quantities;
these are created as needed to reduce the memory demands on the system
in certain situations.

To construct a node which is an exact copy of *theCopy*.

\
Invokes the destructor on all the storage objects created to hold the
coordinates, response quantities, mass and load quantities.

\
Returns the number of degrees-of-freedom, *ndof*, associated with the
node.

Each node, when involved with an analysis, will be associated with a
DOF_Group object. It is the `DOF_Group` that contains the ID of equation
numbers. When invoked this method sets the pointer to that DOF_Group
object.

```{.cpp}
virtual `DOF_Group` \*getDOF_GroupPtr(void);
```

using *setDOF_GroupPtr*. If no pointer has been set a $0$ is returned.

```{.cpp}
virtual const Vector &getCrds(void) const;
```

Returns the original coordinates in a Vector. The size of the vector is
2 if node object was created for a 2d problem and the size is 3 if
created for a 3d problem.

```{.cpp}
virtual const Vector &getDisp(void) ;
```

printed and a $-2$ is returned if *trialIncrAccel* is not of size
*ndof*.

```{.cpp}
virtual void zeroUnbalancedLoad(void);
```

Causes the node to zero out its unbalanced load vector.
*virtual int addUnbalancedLoad(const Vector &additionalLoad, double
fact);*\
The Node is responsible for adding *fact* times *additionalLoad* to the
current unbalanced load at the Node. If *additionalLoad* is not of size
*ndof* no load is added, an error message is printed and a $-1$ is
returned. If no space has yet been allocated for the unbalanced load a
new Vector is now created; if not enough space is available for this
Vector an error message is printed and the program is terminated.
Returns $0$ if successful.

To add **minus** *fact* times the product $M * R * accel$ to the current
unbalanced load. Nothing is done if no mass or R matrix have been set.
Prints a warning and returns a $-1$ if the size of accel and the number
of columns in $R$ are not the same. If no space has yet been allocated
for the unbalanced load a new Vector is now created; if not enough space
is available for this Vector an error message is printed and the program
is terminated. Returns $0$ if successful.

```{.cpp}
virtual const Vector &getUnbalancedLoad(void);
```

Returns the current unbalanced load. If no space has yet been allocated
for the unbalanced load a new Vector of size *numDOF* is now created; if
not enough space is available for this Vector an error message is
printed and the program is terminated.

```{.cpp}
virtual const Vector &getUnbalancedLoadIncInertia(void);
```

Returns the current unbalanced load Vector, as defined above, MINUS the
product of the nodes mass matrix and the trial nodal accelerations. The
result is saved in another vector which is returned. If no space has yet
been allocated for this new Vector, a Vector of size *numDOF* is now
created; if not enough space is available for this Vector an error
message is printed and the program is terminated.

```{.cpp}
virtual int commitState(void);
```

Causes the node to set the committed model displacements, velocities and
accelerations to be equal to the current trial displacements, velocities
and accelerations. The incremental displacement is set to $0$. No
assignment is done for any of the quantities for which no memory has
been allocated. Returns $0$.

```{.cpp}
virtual int revertToLastCommit(void);
```

Causes the node to set the trial nodal displacements, velocities and
accelerations to be equal to the current committed displacements,
velocities and accelerations. The incremental displacement is set to
$0$. No assignment is done for any of the trial quantities for which no
memory has been allocated. Returns $0$.

```{.cpp}
virtual int revertToStart(void);
```

Causes the node to set the trial and committed nodal displacements,
velocities and accelerations to zero. No assignment is done for any of
the trial quantities for which no memory has been allocated. Returns
$0$.

```{.cpp}
virtual const Matrix &getMass(void) ;
```

Returns the mass matrix set for the node, which is a matrix of size
*ndof,ndof*. This matrix is equal to that set in `setMass()` or zero if
`setMass()` has not been called. If no storage space has been allocated
for the mass, a matrix is now created. An error message is printed and
the program terminated if no space is available on the heap for this
matrix.

```{.cpp}
virtual int setMass(const Matrix &mass);
```

Sets the value of the mass at the node. A check is made to ensure that
the *mass* has the same dimensions of the mass matrix associated with
the Node; if incompatible size an error message is printed and -1
returned. If no mass matrix yet allocated, one is created; if no space
is available an error message is printed and the program terminated.
Returns 0 if successful.

Creates a Matrix to store the R matrix. The matrix is of dimension
*ndof* and *numCol*. If not enough space is available for this matrix an
error message is printed and the program is terminated. Zeros the matrix
R and returns $0$ if successful.

Sets the *$row,col$* entry of R to be equal to *Value*. If no matrix R
has been specified or the position in R is out of range a warning
message is printed and a $-1$ is returned. Returns $0$ if successful.

This is a method provided for Element objects, the Node object returns
the product of the matrix $R$ and the vector $V$. If the matrix and
vector are of inappropriate size a warning message is printed and a zero
vector is returned.

```{.cpp}
virtual int sendSelf(int commitTag, Channel &theChannel);
```

Causes the Node object to send the data needed to init itself on a
remote machine to the Channel object *theChannel*. The data sent
includes the tag, number of dof, coordinates, committed response
quantities, unbalanced load, mass and participation matrix. To do this
the Node creates an ID object into which it stores its tag, the *ndof*
and a flag indicating whether any additional information, i.e. mass,
response quantities also need to be sent. In addition four database tags
are also included in this ID object. The database tags, if not already
obtained, are requested from the Channel object (these are needed as
each object can only store a single object of a particular size using
it's own database tags -- additional tags are needed when multiple
objects of the same size are needed. The objects that have been created
are then sent.
*virtual int recvSelf(int commitTag, Channel &theChannel,
FEM_ObjectBroker &theBroker);*\
Invoked on a remote machine to read its data that was sent by a node
object in another actor when `sendSelf()` was invoked. As in
`sendSelf()`, the Node object creates an ID object. It asks the Channel
object to fill this object with data. Based on the data it creates
Matrix and Vector objects to store the Nodes data and asks the Channel
object to fill these with data. The data placed here by the Channel
object correspond to the data put there by the sending Node object.

```{.cpp}
void Print(OPS_Stream &s, int flag = 0);
```

Causes the Node to print out its tag, mass matrix, and committed
response quantities.

Causes the Node to display itself. If *flag* is $1$ the Node will cause
its tag to be printed to the display.
