<p>This manual is intended to outline the basic commands currently
available within the OpenSees interpreter for performing DDM
(<strong>Direct Differentiation Method</strong>)-based response
sensitivity analysis. This interpreter is an extension of the Tcl/Tk
language for use with OpenSees. The existing Tcl commands for Finite
Element response-only computation are described in the OpenSees userâ€™s
guide available online at <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu">http://opensees.berkeley.edu</a>
and, thus, are not repeated in this document. The notation used herein
is the same as that used in the Tcl commands manual for response-only
computation. Only new Tcl commands for DDM-based response sensitivity
computation are presented and explained in detail.</p>
<p>This manual is subdivided as follows:</p>

<li><a href="DDM-Based_Response_Sensitivity_Computation_Tcl_Commands:"
title="wikilink">DDM-Based Response Sensitivity Computation Tcl
Commands:</a> commands added to the interpreter for response sensitivity
computation.</li>

Examples:</a> five demonstration examples used to illustrate and
validate the DDM-based response sensitivity analysis components
implemented in OpenSees.</li>
