# OpenSeesWiki:About

<p>OpenSeesWiki is a Wiki creation. The goal is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>To provide information about OpenSees to the general OpenSees
community.</li>
<li>To allow community members to provide content for the education of
all.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>We cannot do it all (nor do we know it all) and we would
encourage you to help out.</strong></p>
