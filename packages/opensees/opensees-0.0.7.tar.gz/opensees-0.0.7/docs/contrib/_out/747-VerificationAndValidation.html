# VerificationAndValidation

<p>While incredible useful and powerful, numerical tools such as
OpenSees can produce misleading and wrong results. This can be due to
errors in the application code, the unsuitability of the users modeling
choices for the system being analyzed, or user error in the input file.
What this document provides are example code that have been used to
verify the correctness of the code, i.e. it's
<strong>verification</strong>. Examples in the literature exist that
demonstrate the validity of the modules for a limited number of
different systems. Without taking control of the analysis away from you,
there is little we can do to protect you from yourself (inappropriate
choice of model and user error!)</p>
<p>Before we begin, here are what we mean by
<strong>Verification</strong> and <strong>Validation</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Verification</strong> of a software component is the process
of comparing the results for that component with a known analytical
solution. Our definition of verification, sometimes called
<strong>formal verification</strong> is in agreement with the Wikipedia
definition: "is the act of proving or disproving the correctness of
intended algorithms underlying a system with respect to a certain formal
specification or property, using formal methods of mathematics"</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong> of the model deals with comparing how
well the model compares with results for the actual physical system that
the model is being used to predict the behaviour of. This is in
agreement with the American Association of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)
definition of the validation process: “Validation can be defined as the
process of determining the degree to which a model is an accurate
representation of the real word from the perspective of the intended
uses of the model”. Two things to note: (1) the model can be validated,
not the software which takes as input the model, and (2) that the
assessment of the accuracy between the simulation and the real world is
subjective and has to be made relatively to the "intended use" of that
particular model.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you see, both verification and validation are related to a
comparison process. They differ from each other for the type of results
against which the comparison is carried out. Verification consists in
comparing the numerical results against a known theoretical solution of
the specific problem under investigation, while the validation refers to
the comparison of the numerical model with a physical experiment which
reproduces the particular phenomenon under investigation. As such,
verification is not also a condition sufficient to guarantee that
results obtained from the numerical model are correct. The theoretical
model may itself be incorrect!, the assumptions it makes may not be
suited to your system or may not be suited to the response quantities of
interest to you. Hence, once a model has been verified, it is also
necessary to validate the results against one or more experimental
tests. In our field, given the limited number of experimental tests and
the fact that no test probably exists for the exact system being
modeled, the validation that has been performed is typically limited to
different systems than your own. Great care must then be taken by you
the user in determining the accuracy of the results for your particular
model. (Between you and me, and given what you know about validation,
always treat with suspicion anyone would would state that there
application code has been fully validated!)</p>
<p>The Verification of software is an important topic, it is also a time
consuming endeavour and we do the best we can with the limited resources
available. For OpenSees we typically do <strong>dynamic
black-box</strong> testing of the code, in which we execute the OpenSees
application with a given set of test cases that endeavour to cover as
much of the possible code-branches as possible. In should be noted, that
even if all code branches are tested it is still not a 100% gaurantee of
correctness as the same code block may produce results correctly or
incorrectly depending on the variable values (again be careful when
someone states their code has been fully verified!). In addition some
<strong>white-box unit and system</strong>testing" has been performed.
These are the examples written in C++ and found in the source code
repository.</p>
<p>This following presents the set of simple systems that have been
analyzed using OpenSees for verification purposes. While few in number,
as you will see if you look at the reference documents, they are
probably more exhaustive than some of commercial applications! The
OpenSees results are compared against the results from other sources
(verification documents for other finite element and structural analysis
applications, examples in the literature, and hand calculations). The
script examples cover a number of element and material types, solvers,
integrators, solution algorithms, static, dynamic and eigenvalue
analysis. For each system a number of verification scripts may be
provided or multiple analysis may be perfomed in a single script (e.g.
one script could perform repeated analysis using different solvers for
each analysis to verify the workings of the different solvers).</p>
