# Isolator2spring Section

<p>This command is used to construct an Isolator2spring section object,
which represents the buckling behavior of an elastomeric bearing for
two-dimensional analysis in the lateral and vertical plane. An
Isolator2spring section represents the resultant force-deformation
behavior of the bearing, and should be used with a zeroLengthSection
element. The bearing should be constrained against rotation.</p>
<p>The command, its arguments and model description can be found here:

Section</a></p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local x axis of this bearing is in shear direction and local y axis
is in axial direction.</li>
<li>Valid recorder arguments are: 'force', 'basicForce',
'deformation'.</li>
</ul>
