# ShallowFoundationGen

<p>ShallowFoundationGen command generates (i) the node numbers and
corresponding coordinates for foundation and spring elements, (ii)
material type and properties of each created element, and (iii) nodal
fixity required to define a two-dimensional
Beam-on-Nonlinear-Winkler-Foundation (BNWF) model.</p>

```tcl
ShallowFoundationGen $FoundationTag $ConnectNode
        $InputFileName $FootingCondition

<p>NOTE:</p>
<ol>
<li>that QzSimple2, PxSimple1 and TxSimple1 materials (Raychowdhury
2008) are modified versions of QzSimple1, PySimple1 and TzSimple1
materials introduced by Boulanger (2000).</li>
<li>An intermediate file containing the mesh details will be generated
and will be named as per the FoundationTag specified. For example, if a
structure has three shallow foundations, and the foundations are
numbered as 1, 2 and 3, then the FoundationTags for those three
foundations would be 1, 2 and 3, respectively, and the OpenSees
generated intermediate output files will automatically be named as
"Foundation_1.tcl", "Foundation_2.tcl" and "Foundation_3.tcl",
respectively.</li>
<li>the code assumes that the structure is supported at the center of a
symmetric footing. For example, if the user specifies the ConnectNode to
be 1, node 1 of the structure will be connected to the mid node of the
shallow foundation, and the degrees of freedom of these two nodes will
be the same (i.e. same generalized displacements for these two
nodes).</li>
<li>The uncommented lines (lines that are not starting with #) of this
file should be in the following sequence:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>SoilProp $SoilType $c $phi $gamma $G $nu $crad $TP</li>
<li>FootProp $Lf $Bf $Hf $Df $Ef $Wg $beta</li>
<li>MeshProp $Rk $Re $Se</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>where SoilType implies type of soil (i.e., sand or clay). SoilType =
1 represents clay and SoilType = 2 represents sand. Intermediate soil
types (such as silt) have to be represented by either sand or clay
depending upon their relative dominance; c =Cohesion, phi = Friction
angle (in degree), gamma = Unit weight, G = Shear modulus, nu =
Poisson's ratio, crad = Radiation damping (in fraction), TP = Tension
capacity (in fraction of bearing capacity, maximum value is 0.1), Lf =
Length of footing, Bf = Width of footing, Hf = Height of footing, Df =
Depth of embedment, Ef = Young's modulus for footing material, beta
=Inclination of the load on the foundation with respect to vertical
direction, (in degree), Rk = Stiffness intensity ratio of vertical
springs (kend/kmid), Re = End length ratio (Lend/Lf ) and Se = vertical
spring spacing as a fraction of total footing length (le/Lf ).</p>
<p>If user wants to input the foundation strength and stiffness directly
instead of allowing the command to calculate those, first command line
can be replaced with the following alternate command line:</p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>CapSoil $Qult $Pult $Tult $Kv $Kh</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>where, Qult = Vertical bearing capacity, Pult = Passive resistance
capacity, Tult = Sliding resistance capacity, Kv = Vertical stiffness of
footing and Kh = Lateral stiffness of footing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Footings with different base conditions will be generated as
follows:</li>
