# OpenSees &amp; Output, Nov 2011

<p>After an OpenSees analysis there is no output unless it is requested.
There are several ways of getting output from OpenSees analysis.
OpenSees commands along with Tcl commands can be combined to create
different types of outputs. In this web-based seminar, the various ways
of creating output in OpenSees will be discussed and the primary use of
each method will be demonstrated. In addition, OpenSees commands for
creating graphical images of OpenSees models are going to be
demonstrated. With proper use of the output options, users will find
that their speed will be enhanced when checking their model's accuracy
and processing data of interest after an analysis. This seminar
covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to Output options</li>
<li>OpenSees commands for creating the output: recorder, print, recorder
display, commands that return values (e.g., nodeDisp) - demonstrated by
examples</li>
<li>Tcl "puts" command for creating the output - demonstrated by
example</li>
</ul>
