<p>Special Concentrically Braced Frames (SCBF) are commonly used as the
seismic resisting system in buildings. During large seismic events they
may experience buckling of the braces. These inelastic deformation of
the braces place inelastic deformation demands on beams, columns and
connections. Although the most accurate way to analytically capture the
response of such systems is by using continuum models (based on shell or
brick elements) it is time consuming and computationally expensive.
Simplified but relatively accurate nonlinear model of a SCBF can be
developed in OpenSees using beam-column (line-frame) elements. Such
model can provide accurate simulation of global behavior, while
retaining simplicity and providing reasonable predictions for many local
behaviors. Force-based beam-column elements can be used to model the
braces, beams and columns. Simulation of brace-buckling behavior can be
achieved by using several nonlinear elements along the length of the
brace that include nonlinear geometric effects and have perturbed
geometry to simulate imperfection of the brace. Generation of such a
model with three models of gusset plate connection will be demonstrated
in this webinar. These include modeling of gusset plate using: (i)
nonlinear elements, (ii) rotational springs, (iii) pins. While the first
two models of the gusset plate connections can provide accurate
responses of the system, the pinned gusset plate connection results in
significant loss in accuracy.</p>
