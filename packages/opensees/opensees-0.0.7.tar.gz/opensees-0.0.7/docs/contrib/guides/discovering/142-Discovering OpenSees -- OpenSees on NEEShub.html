# Discovering OpenSees -- OpenSees on NEEShub

<p>In addition to being a platform that runs on a personal computer,
OpenSees is now available for use on NEEShub (http://nees.org) through
the OpenSeesLaboratory tool. <a
href="http://nees.org/resources/openseeslab">http://nees.org/resources/openseeslab</a>.
By using this free tool, users can run analyses remotely on the NEEShub
machines that are extremely fast. This can be very useful to advanced
OpenSees users because it will drastically decrease computational time
for large models or analyses that need to perform many runs. For new
users, the OpenSeesLaboratory tool allows you to trial OpenSees without
any initial set-up or installation.</p>
<p>This session focuses on how to use OpenSees through the
OpenSeesLaboratory tool on NEEShub. It covers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to get a personal storage on NEEShub</li>
<li>How to find the OpenSees Laboratory tool on NEEShub</li>
<li>How to send an OpenSees input file to your storage on NEEShub</li>
<li>How to run your file using OpenSees Laboratory tool</li>
<li>How to get the output files back to your own computer after the
analysis is complete</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PPT presentation that guides you step by step on how to run
OpenSees files through NEEShub can be downloaded from here:</strong></p>
