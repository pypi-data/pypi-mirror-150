href="http://openfresco.berkeley.edu/users/express/">OpenFresco<em>Express</em></a>
is a self-contained software package, including an easy-to-use graphical
user interface (GUI), which facilitates hybrid testing of systems having
up to two degrees of freedom. OpenFresco<em>Express</em> addresses the
needs of a wide range of users including:</p>
<ul>
<li>laboratory staff and research students learning about hybrid
simulation and starting to use this experimental testing method.</li>
<li>staff and students at laboratories that regularly use hybrid
simulation but desire a tool for quick demonstration of the hybrid
simulation testing method.</li>
<li>researchers who are conducting simple tests and would like to take
advantage of a graphical user interface that quickly and easily displays
useful real-time test data.</li>
<li>graduate students and researchers who are not at a laboratory but
wish to run the software as a pure simulation tool to learn more about
hybrid simulation and how it works.</li>
</ul>
<p>The seminar will provide an introduction to the hybrid simulation
testing technique and illustrate how OpenFresco<em>Express</em> can be
used to graphically setup a hybrid model and execute a hybrid
simulation. The following topics will be covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to hybrid simulation</li>
<li>Downloading and installing <a
href="http://openfresco.berkeley.edu/users/express/">OpenFresco<em>Express</em></a></li>
<li>Example 1: building your first hybrid model</li>
<li>Simulated versus real controllers</li>
<li>Error monitors: assessing the goodness of a test</li>
<li>Example 2: two-story building</li>
<li>Resources for more complicated hybrid tests</li>
<li>Summary and conclusions</li>
</ul>
