# Adding your own code to OpenSees, Jan 2012

<p>OpenSees is a widely used in both research and practice. To date over
50,000 users have downloaded the application. OpenSees is primarily a
research tool intended to allow developers to quickly test new theories
using the finite element method, whether this be new material, element,
algorithm, integrator, solver, .... .The advantage of OpenSees is the
ease with which these new components can be added to the application so
that they may be tested and verified by the developers. The intent of
this seminar is to show just how EASY this can really be.</p>
