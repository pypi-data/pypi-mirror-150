# OpenSees Developer

<p>OpenSees Developer pages are intended for application developers of
OpenSees. OpenSees is a software framework for developing sequential and
parallel finite element applications applications for structural and
geotechnical engineering.</p>
<p>The OpenSees code is open-source and released under a modified GPL.
The modification allows users to use the source code for their own use.
It does not allow them to sell a product that includes OpenSees code.
The interpreters are written in such a way that developers wishing to
gain financial advantage could for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create pre and post processors for the OpenSees interpreters.</li>
<li>Create new modules, i.e. elements, materials, solvers, integrators,
... for the OpenSees interpreters.</li>
</ol>
<p>The code is made open-source and free to use and expand upon for a
number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linus's Law: Given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow.</li>
<li>Free software attracts users.</li>
<li>New ideas can be explored and built upon if they are available to be
scrutinized.</li>
<li>Too much software developed in Civil Engineering research
institutions is lost when graduate students leave.</li>
<li>The software developed in Civil Engineering research requires
greater testing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design_of_the_framework">Design of the Framework</h2>
<p>The initial design of the framework is outlined 'Object-Oriented
Finite Element Programming: Frameworks for Analysis, Algorithm and
Parallel Computing (1997), F.McKenna' <a
href="http://OpenSees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/doc/fmkdiss.pdf">link</a>.
Some of the interfaces in the dissertation have been modified over
time.</p>
<p>Over time there has been many additions made to the framework, though
the original design has remained basically the same. There have been
many people who have contributed greatly to the framework over time.
Their contributions are noted in the classes that they have developed.
Whenever possible, we encourage you to cite these persons and their work
in articles, if your work relies on using their code specifically or if
you build upon developing your own.</p>

<h2 id="adding_new_components_to_the_framework">Adding New Components to
the Framework</h2>
<p>External code can be added to the OpenSees interpreters using dynamic
link libraries on Windows (DLL) and Mac (dylib), and shared objects
(.so) on Unix machines. Example code can be obtained from the following
svn repository: <a
href="svn://peera.berkeley.edu/usr/local/svn/OpenSees/trunk/DEVELOPER">svn://peera.berkeley.edu/usr/local/svn/OpenSees/trunk/DEVELOPER</a>
. The following articles contain instruction for each of the different
types of classes that can be added to the interpreters:</p>

<h2 id="building_the_software_on_parallel_machines">Building The
Software on Parallel Machines</h2>
<p>OpenSees parallel versions are quite necessary when the models are
large and also require many runs. They can reduce the analysis time
drastically, harnessing the power of modern day parallel computers. But
one big challenge in doing so, is to compile OpenSeesMP or OpenSeeSP in
linux based machines as most of the powerful parallel computers are
using linux based OS.</p>
<p>In the following section a step by step procedure for compilation of
OpenSeesMP is described.</p>
