# Getting Started with OpenSees -- Lateral Loads -- Static Pushover

<p>The following commands assume that the example.tcl and the
gravityloads.tcl files have been run. The wipe command should be used at
the beginning of the input to clear any previous OpenSees-objects
definition:</p>
<p>
```Tcl
 wipe source example.tcl source
gravityloads.tcl 
```
</p>
<p>In this analysis, a lateral displacement of increasing amplitude is
imposed at the free nodes (3 and 4). The imposed displacements are
applied using a displacement-control integrator, where the load factors
are scaled to reach the desired displacement (compared to an
imposed-displacement analysis). This method is the most efficient when
you have a non-strength-degrading system.</p>
<p>The first step is to define the load pattern. To do so, we create a
new load pattern (ID tag 2) for the lateral loads &lt;source
lang="Tcl"&gt; pattern Plain 2 Linear { load 3 100.0 0.0 0.0 load 4
100.0 0.0 0.0 } 
```
</p>
<p>Most of the analysis features that were defined in the gravity
analysis are still valid since this type of analysis is also static. The
loads, however, are applied differently. While gravity was applied as a
load, using the LoadControl integrator, the DisplacementControl
integrator is used in this pushover:</p>
<p><em>integrator DisplacementControl $nodeTag $dofTag $dU1 &lt;$Jd
$minDu $maxDu&gt;</em></p>
<p>The load is applied to node 3, in the direction of DOF 1, with a
displacement increment of 0.1</p>
<p>
```Tcl
 integrator DisplacementControl 3 1 0.1

```
</p>
<p>A total of a 1-inch displacement needs to be applied, hence 10 steps
are needed:</p>
<p>
```Tcl
 analyze 10 
```
