# Getting Started with OpenSees -- Model Builder

<p>Defining the model builder using the OpenSees <a href="model_command"
title="wikilink">model command</a> expands the Tcl command library to
include OpenSees-specific commands, such as node and element definition,
etc. Currently, there is only one model builder available, basic model
builder, this is the model builder that includes all the commands
presented in this library.</p>
<p>The model builder also defines the number of dimensions (ndm) and
degrees of freedom per node (ndf):</p>
<p><em>model BasicBuilder -ndm $ndm &lt;-ndf $ndf&gt;</em></p>
<p>For a 2-D problem, you really only need three degrees of freedom at
each node, the two translations in the plane and the rotation about the
plane's normal:</p>
<dl>
<dt>model basic -ndm 2 -ndf 3</dt>

</dl>
