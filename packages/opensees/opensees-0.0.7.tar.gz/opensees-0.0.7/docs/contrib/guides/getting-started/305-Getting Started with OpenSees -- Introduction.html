# Getting Started with OpenSees -- Introduction

<p>Modern earthquake engineering utilizes modeling and simulation to
understand the behavior and performance of systems during earthquakes.
With the support of the National Science Foundation, the Pacific
Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER) has developed the Open
System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation, OpenSees for short, as a
software platform for research and application of simulation for
structural and geotechnical systems.</p>
<p>The OpenSees software framework uses object-oriented methodologies to
maximize modularity and extensibility for implementing models for
behavior, solution methods, and data processing and communication
procedures. The framework is a set of inter-related classes, such as
domains (data structures), models, elements (which are hierarchical),
solution algorithms, integrators, equation solvers, and databases. The
classes are as independent as possible, which allows great flexibility
in combining modules to solve simulation problems for buildings and
bridges, including soil and soil-structure-foundation interaction, and
most recently including reliability computational modules. The open
source software is managed and made available to users and developers
through the OpenSees website at <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu"><a

<p>The software architecture and open-source approach for OpenSees
provide many benefits to users interested in advanced simulation of
structural and geotechnical systems with realistic models of nonlinear
behavior. First, the modeling approach is very flexible in that allows
selection and various combinations of a number of different element
formulations and material formulations, along with different
approximations of kinematics to account for large-displacements and P-D
effects. As an open-source project, developers and researchers are using
the extensible features of the software architecture to add additional
capability. A second advantage is that there is a wide range of solution
procedures and algorithms that the user can adapt to solve difficult
nonlinear problems for static and dynamic loads. Another feature is that
OpenSees has a fully programmable scripting language for defining
models, solution procedures, and post-processing that can provide simple
problem solving capability, as illustrated in this manual, or very
sophisticated modeling and parameters studies of large, complex systems.
Finally, OpenSees provides a flexible interface to computer resources,
storage and databases, and network communication to take advantage of
high-end computing systems. Structural and geotechnical models can be
analyzed from desktop PC's to parallel computers within OpenSees.</p>
<p>As an advanced platform for computational simulation, OpenSees
provides an important resource for the National Science
Foundation-sponsored George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake
Engineering Simulation (NEES), and it has been adopted by NEESgrid
System Integration project as the NEES simulation component. The
NEESgrid decision to utilize OpenSees and adapt it to interface with
other NEESgrid resources provides an important capability for NEES
researchers and users. The modular design of OpenSees means that it can
be customized for the integrating physical and computation simulation
through data repositories, visualization, and hybrid control for
advanced experimental methods, all of which meet important NEES
objectives.</p>
<p>Open source software, such as OpenSees, requires community support
and participation. The objective of this "Getting Started" manual is to
provide an introduction so that users of OpenSees can obtain, install,
and begin using the software to solve problems.</p>
