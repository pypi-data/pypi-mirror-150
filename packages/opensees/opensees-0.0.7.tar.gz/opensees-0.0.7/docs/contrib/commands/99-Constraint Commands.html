<p>&lt;noinclude&gt;Currently, only one constraint handler has been

```tcl
constraints constraintType? arg1? ...
```
<hr />
<p>The type of ConstraintHandler created and the additional arguments

<p>The following contain information about numbererType? and the args
required for each of the available constraint handler types:</p>
