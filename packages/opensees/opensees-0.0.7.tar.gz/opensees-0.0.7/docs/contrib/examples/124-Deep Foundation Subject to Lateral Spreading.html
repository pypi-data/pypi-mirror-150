<p>This article discusses an OpenSees analysis of a single deep
foundation subject to a kinematic loading which simulates lateral
spreading. The deep foundation is embedded in a layered soil profile in
which a liquefiable layer separates an upper crustal layer and a deeper,
denser soil layer. The laterally-loaded deep foundation is modeled as a
beam on nonlinear Winkler foundation (BNWF). Elastic beam-column
elements are used for the deep foundation, and nonlinear <em>p-y</em>
spring elements represent the soil. Lateral spreading is simulated in
the BNWF model by imposing an applied displacement profile to the soil
end of the nonlinear springs in a similar manner to that presented by
Brandenberg et al. (2007). The displacement profile is constant across
the upper crustal layer, varied linearly across the liquefied layer, and
is zero in the lower soil layer.</p>
<p>This example also briefly discusses the use of <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a> to generate input files for
OpenSees. The scripts necessary for this process are provided. These
scripts allow for the generation of OpenSees input files based on
various specified parameters such as the diameter and depth of the deep
foundation and the properties of the soil layers.</p>
<p>Provided with this article are several files. Files which are
required for the analysis are indicated. The files include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The example input file, <a href="lateralSpreadPile.tcl"
title="wikilink">lateralSpreadPile.tcl</a> (<strong>required for
analysis</strong>)</li>
<li>The main Matlab driver file, makeInput.m, which can be used to
generate an OpenSees input file for the type of analysis described in
this article</li>
<li>The auxiliary Matlab files, getAPIstiffness.m, getBrinch.m, and
mDataSort.m, which support the main driver file, makeInput.m</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the files mentioned above can be downloaded <a
href="Media:_latSpreadPile.zip" title="wikilink"> here</a>.</p>
<p>To run this example, the user must download the input file, <a
href="lateralSpreadPile.tcl" title="wikilink">lateralSpreadPile.tcl</a>.
The additional files described above are not essential to the analysis.
They are provided to demonstrate how to create OpenSees input files
using outside software and to allow the user to investigate alternative
soil-pile systems.</p>
<p>The provided input file is initially described in the discussion
below, followed by a description of how to use the Matlab scripts, and
some representative results obtained for the example analysis.</p>

<p>The setup for this example is similar to that discussed in the <a
href="Laterally-Loaded_Pile_Foundation"
title="wikilink">Laterally-Loaded Pile Foundation example</a>. The user
is encouraged to refer to that former example for any details which are
omitted in the current discussion. The laterally-loaded deep foundation
is simulated using a BNWF technique in which the foundation is modeled
with beam-column elements and the soil is modeled using a series of
nonlinear <em>p-y</em> springs. An idealized schematic of the
laterally-loaded pile model is provided in Fig. 1. Further discussion on
similar BNWF lateral spreading models is also available in the papers by
McGann et al. (2011,2012).</p>
<p>The pile axis is oriented in the z-coordinate direction, and all of
the nodes are initially located on the z-axis (x- and y- coordinates are
zero). Node numbering for each set of nodes begins at the top of the
pile. The model is created with three separate sets of nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed spring nodes (numbers 2-81 in example)</li>
<li>slave spring nodes (numbers 202-281 in example)</li>
<li>pile nodes (numbers 501-581 in example)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mesh_geometry">Mesh Geometry</h3>
<p>This example considers a layered soil profile in which a weaker
liquefied layer is present between two layers of stronger material. The
upper and lower layers are assumed to consist of identical soil
material. The geometry of the mesh depends on the number of specified
nodes and the specified depth of the deep foundation. In the example
input file, there are 81 nodes and the foundation extends to a depth of
40 m below the ground surface. <strong>Note:</strong> The Matlab scripts
which can be used to generate input files are set to consider a maximum
of 200 nodes. If more nodes are desired, the scripts will require
modification.</p>
<h3 id="boundary_conditions">Boundary Conditions</h3>
<p>The boundary conditions are similar to those explained in the <a
href="Laterally-Loaded_Pile_Foundation"
title="wikilink">Laterally-Loaded Pile Foundation example</a>, though
here, only lateral behavior is modeled so there are some additional
fixities. The soil end of the spring elements are completely fixed, the
pile end of the spring elements are only free in the direction of
loading (x-direction), and the pile nodes are fixed against translation
in the y-direction and rotation out of the plane of loading. The base of
the pile is also fixed against vertical translation (z-direction).</p>
<p>The pile end of the soil springs are linked as slave nodes to their
corresponding pile nodes in the x-direction using the <a
href="equalDOF_command" title="wikilink"> equalDOF</a> command.</p>
<h3 id="material_and_element_definitions">Material and Element
Definitions</h3>
<p>In this example, the soil springs are used to represent the lateral
behavior of the soil only, no vertical constitutive behavior is
assigned. <a href="zeroLength_Element" title="wikilink">ZeroLength
elements</a> are used for the soil springs, and the lateral constitutive
behavior is assigned using the <a href="PySimple1_Material"
title="wikilink">PySimple1</a> uniaxial material object. The input
values for the <a href="PySimple1_Material"
title="wikilink">PySimple1</a> objects are determined using ultimate
lateral resistance values computed using the method of Brinch Hansen
(1961) and initial stiffness values computed using the API (1987)
recommendations modified for depth as discussed by Boulanger et al.
(2003). The raw ultimate resistance and stiffness values computed using
these methods are modified to account for the presence of the weaker
middle layer using the method proposed by McGann et al. (2012). The
provided input file considers a soil friction angle of 36 degrees and a
soil unit weight of 17 kN/m^3.</p>
<p>The deep foundation is modeled using <a
href="Displacement-Based_Beam-Column_Element"
title="wikilink">dispBeamColumn elements</a> with constitutive and
geometric properties assigned using an <a href="Elastic_Section"
title="wikilink">elastic section</a> object. The provided input file
considers a 0.6 m diameter foundation with an elastic modulus of 30 GPa
and Poisson's ratio of 0.3.</p>
<h3 id="loading_and_analysis">Loading and Analysis</h3>
<p>The lateral spreading load case is simulated by enforcing an applied
displacement profile to the fixed (soil) end of the <em>p-y</em> spring
elements. Loading occurs in the x-direction. The applied displacement
profile (see Fig. 1) is constant with a magnitude of one pile radius
over the thickness of the upper soil layer, is zero in the lower soil
layer, and is linearly interpolated across the middle liquefied layer.
Displacements are applied using <a href="sp_Command" title="wikilink">
single-point (sp) constraints</a> inside a <a href="Plain_Pattern"
title="wikilink">plain pattern</a> object. The displacement is applied
incrementally in a static analysis.</p>

<p>A series of Matlab scripts are provided to demonstrate how OpenSees
input files can be generated using outside software. These scripts were
used to generate the provided input file, and can be used to construct
analyses for alternative geometries and constitutive properties. Matlab
was selected to facilitate the computation of the constitutive
parameters required for the <a href="PySimple1_Material"
title="wikilink">PySimple1</a> material objects. These processes could
also be accomplished using tcl scripts.</p>
<p>The script, makeInput.m, is the primary driver for input file
generation. This script requires a series of input parameters, and calls
the remaining scripts during the process of file generation. The
appropriate command to run this script can be expressed as</p>
<p>makeInput(mCase, D, z, T, phi, gamma, pileE, pileNu, nNode, H)</p>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li><em>mCase</em>: is the desired name of the input file in the form of
a string and without the .tcl extension (e.g., 'lateralSpreadPile')</li>
<li><em>D</em>: is the pile diameter in meters (see Fig. 2)</li>
<li><em>z</em>: is the depth to the bottom of the liquefied layer (see
Fig. 2)</li>
<li><em>T</em>: is the thickness of the liquefied layer (see Fig.
2)</li>
<li><em>phi</em>: is the friction angle of the stronger soil layers in
degrees</li>
<li><em>gamma</em>: is the unit weight of the stronger soil layers in
kN/m^3</li>
<li><em>pileE</em>: is the elastic modulus of the deep foundation in
kPa</li>
<li><em>pileNu</em>: is Poisson's ratio for the deep foundation</li>
<li><em>nNode</em>: is the number of desired pile nodes
(<strong>Note:</strong> more than 200 nodes will require modification to
the script)</li>
<li><em>H</em>: is the length of the pile and soil profile in
meters</li>
</ul>
<p>The scripts create the input file based on the supplied geometry and
constitutive parameters. The <em>p-y</em> springs are given constitutive
behavior based on the methods discussed above. The resulting input file
will be located inside a directory with a matching name.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Several plots are provided below to demonstrate the type of results
which can be obtained from this analysis and to allow the user to verify
the proper implementation of the example input file. Figs. 3 and 4 show
the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the deep foundation
during the analysis. These plots include the results for a series of
time steps, each represented as a different color, to show how the
moment and shear change during the lateral spreading event. Fig. 5 shows
the load distribution which is applied to the deep foundation during the
application of the imposed displacement profile. Fig. 6 shows the
displaced shape of the deep foundation at several time steps during the
analysis. Figs. 7 and 8 show the evolution of the absolute magnitude and
position of the maximum moments in the upper and lower soil layers. Fig.
8 also shows the evolution of the effective length (L_effective), which
is the distance between the two maximum moments. The shaded band in
these figures shows the location of the liquefied layer.</p>
