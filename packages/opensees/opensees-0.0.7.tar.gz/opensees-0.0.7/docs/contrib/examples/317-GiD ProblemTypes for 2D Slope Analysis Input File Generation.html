<p>This article describes the use of the tool <a
href="http://gid.cimne.upc.es/home">GiD</a> as a pre- and post-processor
for a 2D analysis of a soil continua in OpenSees. Two separate
procedures are made available for download, one which creates an input
file for an effective stress analysis using nine node quadrilateral
elements, and one which creates an input file for a total stress
analysis using four node quadrilateral elements. Only the former
procedure will be described in this article, as the procedure for the
four node elements is very similar, but less complex. The nine node
element procedure discussed in this article was used to develop the
input file for the <a
href="Dynamic_2D_Effective_Stress_Analysis_of_Slope"
title="wikilink">Dynamic Effective Stress Analysis of a Slope</a>
example posted in the practical examples section of this manual.</p>
<p>GiD can be used for many purposes, one of which is as a pre- or
post-processor for a finite element package. For pre-processing, the
interaction between GiD and a particular outside program is fully
customizable via a series of files called a problem type. The files
which make up the problem type define things such as which materials can
be used, which conditions such as nodal degrees of freedom or fixities
can be assigned, and the formatting and syntax of the input file which
is generated from the GiD mesh. Further information on pre-processing
using GiD, or the use of GiD in general, can be found in the <a
href="http://gid.cimne.upc.es/support/manuals">GiD manual</a>.</p>
<p>The files which define the nine node element procedure discussed in
this article include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GiD problem type, UWnineQuad2Dup.gid, which consists of the
following individual files:
<ul>
<li>UWnineQuad2Dup.bas, a template file which defines how the OpenSees
input file is generated from the GiD input</li>
<li>UWnineQuad2Dup.mat, a file which defines materials for use in
GiD</li>
<li>UWnineQuad2Dup.cnd, a file which defines certain conditions
necessary for the analysis for use in GiD</li>
<li>UWnineQuad2Dup.bat, a batch file which renames the file output by
the procedure as &lt;tt&gt;directory_name.tcl&lt;/tt&gt;</li>
<li>UWnineQuad2Dup.tcl, a file containing two tcl procedures necessary
to the creation of the input file</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The files which define the four node element procedure include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GiD problem type, UWquad2D.gid, which consists of the following
individual files (descriptions correspond to those listed above):
<ul>
<li>UWquad2D.bas</li>
<li>UWquad2D.mat</li>
<li>UWquad2D.cnd</li>
<li>UWquad2D.bat</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="the_uwninequad2dup.gid_problem_type">The UWnineQuad2Dup.gid
Problem Type</h2>
<p>The UWnineQuad2Dup.gid problem type can be used in conjunction with
GiD to generate an OpenSees input file a dynamic analysis of a 2D soil
continua underlain by an elastic half-space. The problem type is set up
for nine node quadrilateral elements with an additional pore pressure
degree of freedom at the corner node, and uses a Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer
(1969) to account for the finite rigidity of the underlying elastic
half-space. Each file in the problem type performs a specific task, and
together they allow GiD to be used as an effective pre-processor for
this type of problem in OpenSees.</p>
<p>It is important to note that using this problem type to create an
input file for a particular analysis does not guarantee that the
generated input file will function perfectly. It is a useful tool which
greatly simplifies the creation of a mesh and the assignment of
materials and conditions for 2D problems, but it does not automatically
create perfect input files. The user must make sure that the input file
was properly generated and must exercise engineering judgment in the
creation of the analysis.</p>
<h3 id="conditions_file___uwninequad2dup.cnd">Conditions File -
UWnineQuad2Dup.cnd</h3>
<p>This file defines the conditions which can be applied to the mesh or
geometry in GiD. These conditions are then used by the template file,
UWnineQuad2Dup.bas, to generate the OpenSees input file from the GiD
mesh. The format of the condition file is described in the <a
href="http://gid.cimne.upc.es/support/manuals">GiD manual</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, this file is a list of the conditions that apply to this
particular problem. These conditions are used to define the degrees of
freedom and the point constraints (fixities) for the nodes, to define
the sets of nodes which are tied in equalDOF to create the free-field
columns discussed in the <a
href="Dynamic_2D_Effective_Stress_Analysis_of_Slope"
title="wikilink">slope analysis example</a>, to identify the slave node
for the Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer dashpot element, and to specify the locations
of nodal masses used to represent the dynamic effects of a body of
water. The value assigned to each question in each condition is the
default value for this condition. These values can be changed when
assigning the conditions in GiD.</p>
<h3 id="material_file___uwninequad2dup.mat">Material File -
UWnineQuad2Dup.mat</h3>
<p>This file specifies the nDMaterials which can be assigned to the
elements in the GiD-generated mesh. As with the condition file, the
material file is a list of materials using the format discussed in the
<a href="http://gid.cimne.upc.es/support/manuals">GiD manual</a>. The
materials which are included in the material file correspond with the
intentions of this problem type to be used for geotechnical analyses.
The available materials for this problem type are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Elastic_Isotropic_Material"
title="wikilink">ElasticIsotropic</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1550.htm">PressureDependMultiYield</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1551.htm">PressureDependMultiYield02</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1558.htm">PressureIndependMultiYield</a></li>
<li><a href="J2_Plasticity_Material"
title="wikilink">J2Plasticity</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these materials are supplied with default values which can be
changed when assigning them in GiD. There are two tabs for each material
type, one for the material parameters (e.g. shear modulus, mass
density), and one for the parameters which are assigned in the nine node
quadrilateral element (undrained bulk modulus, fluid mass density,
horizontal and vertical permeabilities, and body forces). The problem
type is set up so each material has a corresponding set of element
parameters to allow for the analysis of layered soil profiles.</p>
<p>New materials can be made in GiD using these base materials as
templates. For example, in a soil profile in which there are several
layers of sand, different versions of the <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1550.htm">PressureDependMultiYield</a>
wich have separate names and sets of parameters can be created and
assigned to the individual sand layers.</p>
<h3 id="template_file___uwninequad2dup.bas">Template File -
UWnineQuad2Dup.bas</h3>
<p>This file is a template which is used to create an input file for
OpenSees from the mesh, materials, and conditions defined in GiD for a
particular problem. This template defines which information from GiD is
needed in the input file and the format that this information should
follow. Lines preceded by a star (*) indicate commands, comments, or
variables used by GiD during the process. Lines without a preceding star
are printed verbatim into the resultant input file. The file
systematically creates the input file, working from top to bottom,
therefore, the structure of the file corresponds well with the structure
of the resultant input file. This structural similarity can be seen by
comparing the UWnineQuad2Dup.bas file with the input file
slopeAnalysis2Deff.tcl available in the <a
href="Dynamic_2D_Effective_Stress_Analysis_of_Slope"
title="wikilink">Dynamic Effective Stress Analysis of a Slope</a>
example.</p>
<p>In the template file various loops are created which cycle through
the nodes, elements, and materials, excluding or including certain
entities using conditions or layers created and assigned in the GiD
tool. The overall process defined in this file is relatively
straightforward, and the commands used are well explained in the <a
href="http://gid.cimne.upc.es/support/manuals">GiD manual</a>, so a
detailed discussion is not included in this article.</p>
<p>Since the nine node quadrilateral elements have three degrees of
freedom at the corner nodes and two degrees of freedom at the interior
nodes (see the <a href="Dynamic_2D_Effective_Stress_Analysis_of_Slope"
title="wikilink">Dynamic Effective Stress Analysis of a Slope</a>
example for further information), these two sets of nodes must be
separated in some manner. This is accomplished using the tcl procedures
defined in the file UWnineQuad2Dup.tcl, which are called at the top of
the template file. These procedures identify the corner nodes of the
elements and then differentiate these nodes in two ways: (1) the nodes
are assigned to a condition which designates them as having 3 DOF, and
(2) the nodes are assigned to a layer called 'cornerNodes'. These tcl
procedures eliminate the need to manually select each corner node and
assign it to the proper layer and condition in the GiD GUI. Both the
condition and the layer assignments are necessary in order to restrict
certain loops to only those nodes should be included. An example of such
a restriction is the loop in the template file over 3 DOF nodes with
assigned fixities. Loops can only be restricted according to a single
condition at a time, thus, the layer change is necessary for this loop
which needs to restrict nodes based on nodal degrees of freedom and
assigned point constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Apparently due to the process used to
differentiate the corner nodes from the interior nodes, some or all of
the conditions assigned to node number 1 become unassigned. It is not
clear why this occurs or how to prevent it from happening*, but it is
important to remember to check the input file to ensure any conditions
assigned to node 1 are properly included. This covers things such as
nodal fixities and the equalDOF assignments. It may be necessary to
manually add these conditions to the input file. The input file should
always be checked for correctness and the proper implementation of the
analysis set-up, the conditions for node 1 are one of the things that
nearly always need to be addressed. It doesn't appear that this happens
for any node besides node 1. This doesn't seem to be an issue when using
the UWquad2D.gid problem type.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong> If anyone determines why this occurs and/or how to
prevent it from happening, please let me know and I will fix and re-post
the problem type files.</p>
<h2 id="using_the_uwninequad2dup.gid_problem_type">Using the
UWnineQuad2Dup.gid Problem Type</h2>
<p>The use of the UWnineQuad2Dup.gid is fairly simple. A brief overview
of use the provided problem type to create the input file,
slopeAnalysis2Deff.tcl, used in the <a
href="Dynamic_2D_Effective_Stress_Analysis_of_Slope"
title="wikilink">Dynamic Effective Stress Analysis of a Slope</a>
example follows. To use the problem type, the user must download the
file <a href="Media:_UWGiDproblemTypes.zip" title="wikilink">
UWnineQuad2Dup.gid</a> and then save it in the GiD problem types
directory. On a Windows machine, for a default installation of GiD, this
directory should be located on the path &lt;tt&gt;C:\Program
Files\GiD\GiD (version number)\problemtypes&lt;/tt&gt; or something
similar. Once this has been done, the problem type can be assigned to a
project in the GiD GUI as shown in the left side of the figure below.
After the problem type has been assigned, the conditions shown in the
right side of the figure below should be available.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">probType1.png</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These conditions can then be assigned to the mesh or to the geometry
which has been created in GiD. Some examples of condition assignments
are shown below. The left hand side shows the assignment of point
constraints (fixities) for the 3 DOF nodes in the mesh. As shown,
multiple versions of the same condition can be assigned to separate
groups of nodes. The nodes on the base are fixed only in the vertical
direction (2nd DOF) and the nodes on the upper surface are fixed in the
pore pressure DOF (3rd DOF). TO complete the 3 DOF node constraint
assignments for this example, the additional nodes above the groundwater
table should also have fixed pore pressure degrees of freedom
(assignment not shown). The right hand side of the figure below shows
the assignment of a condition which designates the node to which the
Lysmer-Kulhemyer dashpot element is attached. As shown, the magnitudes
of the bedrock shear wave velocity and mass density can be assigned
during this step.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/OpenSeesRT/contrib/static/probTypeCond.png" title="probTypeCond.png"
alt="probTypeCond.png" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">probTypeCond.png</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The process illustrated below can be used to assign the equalDOF
conditions for the free-field columns discussed in the <a
href="Dynamic_2D_Effective_Stress_Analysis_of_Slope"
title="wikilink">Dynamic Effective Stress Analysis of a Slope</a>
example. There are two conditions, Equal_DOF_01 and Equal_DOF_02. Each
condition should be assigned to a separate free-field column. The left
hand figure shows the assignment of the master and slave nodes on either
side of the free-field column. It doesn't matter which side is
designated as the master nodes or the slave nodes, however, the two
sides must have opposing conditions. These steps can be completed in
either the geometry or mesh views. The right hand figure shows the
assignment of the interior nodes in the middle of the free-field column
elements to the slave equalDOF condition. This step can only be
completed after the mesh has been generated. These nodes don't exist in
the geometry view, therefore,they cannot be selected in that view. For
this example, a corresponding process to that shown below must also be
performed on the right hand free-field column, only this time, the
Equal_DOF_02 condition should be assigned.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/OpenSeesRT/contrib/static/probTypeDOF.png" title="probTypeDOF.png"
alt="probTypeDOF.png" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">probTypeDOF.png</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Material assignments are handled in a similar manner to the condition
assignments. In the figure below, the left hand side shows an example
material assignment form and the optional geometry objects to which
materials can be assigned. As many materials as are desired can be
assigned to the various surfaces (geometry view) or elements (mesh view)
in the model. The default parameters for each material can be changed
during the assignment process to suit the analysis. Parameters
pertaining to the nDMaterials are on the 'Material' tab. Parameters
associated with the nine node quad elements are on the 'Element' tab.
The right side of the figure below shows the assigned materials for the
slope analysis example. Separate materials are used for the free-field
columns in order to ensure that the increased thickness of these
elements are properly handled.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">probTypeMat.png</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once the mesh has been generated and all of the appropriate
conditions and materials have been assigned, the OpenSees input file can
be created by choosing 'Calculate' from the 'Calculate' drop-down menu.
This is shown on the right side of the figure below. When GiD has
successfully completed the generation of the input file, a dialog box
like that shown in the left side of the figure below should appear. Due
to the technique used to differentiate the corner nodes from the
interior nodes of the nine node elements, the first time an input file
is made from a new mesh, it is necessary to run the calculation process
twice in order to obtain an input file which lists all of the nodes in
the mesh. This is a quirk of the automatic node identification process
in the UWnineQuad2Dup.gid problem type. The calculation process need
only be applied a single time for the UWquad2D.gid problem type.</p>

<p>The steps necessary to use GiD as a post-processor for this type of
problem are discussed in the <a
href="Dynamic_2D_Effective_Stress_Analysis_of_Slope"
title="wikilink">Dynamic Effective Stress Analysis of a Slope</a>
example. A series of Matlab scripts are provided there which convert the
data recorded by OpenSees during the analysis into a series of results
which can be read by and visualized in GiD. Please refer to the other
example for further information.</p>
<h2 id="the_uwquad2d.gid_problem_type">The UWquad2D.gid Problem
Type</h2>
<p>The UWquad2D.gid problem type was developed to be used with <a
href="Quad_Element" title="wikilink">four node quadrilateral
elements</a>. This is the main difference between this problem type and
the UWnineQuad2Dup.gid problem type discussed above. Restricting the
scope to four node quad elements simplifies the template file, as there
no longer is a need to differentiate between two sets of nodes based on
nodal degrees of freedom. The material file is modified to exclude the
element parameters which apply to the nine node elements, but do not
apply to the four node elements. The conditions are similarly modified,
with conditions which are unnecessary for the four node elements being
removed.</p>
<p>The use of this problem type is very similar to using the
UWnineQuad2Dup.gid problem type. One must create a geometry and mesh in
GiD, assign the proper conditions and materials, and then generate the
input file. There are somewhat fewer steps since the complications which
apply to the nine node elements have been removed. With respect to
post-processing, it is no longer necessary to create a post-process mesh
file, the original mesh used to generate the input file can be used to
define the mesh for the post-processor. The user must still create the
post-process results file, however, for when working with four node
elements, this file can be saved into the original project directory as
opposed to a specially-created post-processing project directory.</p>
