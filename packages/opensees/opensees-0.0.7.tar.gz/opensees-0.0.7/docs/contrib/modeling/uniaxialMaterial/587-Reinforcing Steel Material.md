<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This simulation is based on the Chang and
Mander(1994) uniaxial steel model. The simulation has incorporated
additional reversal memory locations to better control stress
overshooting (default is 10 branches but this can be easily modified by
changing the variable "`LastRule_RS`" within the header file
"`ReinforcingSteel.h`"). The cycle counting method implemented in the
routine achieves the same result as rainflow counting. Fatigue
parameters are based on the Coffin-Manson equation for plastic strain
amplitude as indicated in Figure 6a. The buckling simulations
incorporated consist of a variation on Gomes and Appleton (1997) and
Dhakal and Maekawa (2002). The buckling and fatigue portions of this
simulation are still being further enhanced and refined. Additional
buckling and fatigue options should be available in the near future.</p>

<p><em>Figure 1: Material Constants</em></p>

<p><strong>BACKBONE CURVE:</strong> The backbone curve shown in Figure 1
is used as a bounding surface for the reinforcing bar simulation. This
backbone curve is shifted as described by Chang and Mander (1994) to
account for Isotropic hardening. This backbone can be obtained by
utilizing simple tension test data. Within the material class, the
backbone curve is transformed from engineering stress space to natural
stress space (accounting for change in area as the bar is stressed.)
This allows the single backbone to represent both tensile and
compressive stress-strain relations. The tension and compression
backbone curves are not the same in engineering stress space for this
model! This transformation assumes small strain relations described by
Dodd and Restrepo-Posada (1995)</p>
<p>The softening region (strain greater than eult), shown in Figure 1,
is a localization effect due to necking and is a function of the gage
length used during measurement. This geometric effect is ignored in this
simulation. In this simulation, it is assumed that there is no softening
in natural stress space. Because the simulation always converts back to
engineering stress space, you will observe some softening in the tension
response due to the reduction in area, however this will be much smaller
than that shown in the original backbone curve proposed by Chang and
Mander.</p>
<p><strong>DIMINISHING YIELD PLATEAU:</strong> It has been observed that
when a reinforcing bar is subjected to plastic strain reversals within
the yield plateau, strain hardening will initiate at a lower strain that
that of the same bar loaded monotonically. Additionally, isotropic
hardening can result from repeated strain reversals and is commonly
related to accumulated plastic strain. These two aspects of the
stress-strain behavior of steel bars are somewhat related and that by
shortening the yield plateau as a function of accumulated plastic
strain, the model will have some capability to simulate both the
diminishing yield plateau and isotropic hardening. The Chang and Mander
model, on which this formulation is based, models only anisotropic
hardening by shifting the backbone curves and by targeting previous
reversal points on the backbone curves. By adding a component of
isotropic hardening, the model has additional capabilities and is able
to more accurately simulate test data.</p>
<p>Accumulated plastic strain is tracked within the material model for
each branch, plateau adjustments are made only in the outer branches for
simplicity. The plastic strain due to the backbone curve is ignored so
that a monotonically loaded sample can be calibrated to a monotonic test
sample more easily.</p>

<p>GOMES AND APPLETON BUCKLED CURVE: Figure 3 describes the use of the
buckling parameters modified from Gomes and Appleton(1997). ÃŸ is an
amplification factor that allows the user to scale the buckling curve.
This is useful to adjust the location of the bifurcation point. The r
factor is used to adjust the curve between the buckled curve and the
unbuckled curve. The variable r can only be a real number between 0.0
and 1.0. The g factor is the positive stress location about which the
buckling factor is initiated. This factor was introduced to avoid kinks
in the reloading branch. The implementation of the g factor is shown in
Figure 3. The basic idea is that the stress strain curves are reduced
toward the positive stress g&lt;em
class="emphasis"&gt;f&lt;/em&gt;<sub
class="subscript">su</sub>. g should be between 0.0 and 1.0. A
g of 0.0 will factor to the zero stress axis. This will usually produce
a kink in the reloading curve at the zero stress location. Good results
have been obtained using the following values for the buckling
constants.</p>

<p>DHAKAL AND MAEKAWA BUCKLED CURVE: The buckling model described in
this section is based on Dhakal and Maekawa(2002). This model takes two
terms, lsr and a. lsr is the slenderness ratio as described in Figure 2
and a is an amplification factor. Dhakal and Maekawa suggest a value of
a =1.0 for linear strain hardening and a =0.75 for elastic perfectly
plastic material behavior. The material model in this implementation is
neither linear strain hardening nor elastic perfectly plastic. However,
since the material model does include strain hardening a=1.0 has been
assumed as the default value. Figure 5 shows the unbuckled vs buckled
stress strain response curves.</p>

<p>CYCLIC DEGRADATION: C<sub class="subscript">f</sub> and a
are factors used to relate the number of half cycles to fracture to the
half cycle plastic strain amplitude (Figure 6a). Plastic strain half
cycle amplitude is defined by Equation 1. The total half cycle strain
amplitude,, is shown in Figure 6b as the change in strain from reversal
A to reversal B. C<sub class="subscript">f</sub> and a are
used to define a cumulative damage factor, D, as described in Equation
2.</p>

<p>The cumulative damage factor is zero at no damage and 1.0 at
fracture. Once a bar has been determined to have fractured, the strength
is rapidly degraded to zero.</p>

<p>Figure 7: Strength Reduction</p>
<p>A degrade constant, K<sub class="subscript">1</sub>, is
used to describe loss in strength due to damage or other phenomenon
resulting in softening due to plastic reversals. The degradation is
currently assumed to have a simple linear relationship with D. This is
used to correlate strength degradation to the cumulative damage factor.
This linear relationship is shown in Equation 3.</p>
<p><img src="/OpenSeesRT/contrib/static/ReinfSteel2443.png" title="ReinfSteel2443.png"
alt="ReinfSteel2443.png" /> (3)</p>
<p>Alternately this simple linear equation can be rewritten in a way
that makes the strength degradation independent of the number of half
cycles to failure. Keeping the failure and degradation terms independent
is convenient for calibration. Equation 3 is rewritten below utilizing
the strength degradation constant C<sub
class="subscript">d</sub>.</p>
<p><img src="/OpenSeesRT/contrib/static/ReinfSteel2444.png" title="ReinfSteel2444.png"

<p>The constants K<sub class="subscript">1</sub>, and
C<sub class="subscript">d</sub> can be related as shown in

<p>Suggested starting values have been obtained from data reported by
Brown and Kunnath (2000) for bars with a slenderness of 6. Keep in mind
that this experimental data is limited and additional calibration may be
necessary to capture realistic behavior in a reinforcing bar embedded in
concrete and influenced by other factors such as confinement.</p>

<p>Sample Simulations of Degradation behavior</p>
<p>a is best obtained from calibration of test results. a is used to
relate damage from one strain range to an equivalent damage at another
strain range. This is usually constant for a material type.</p>
<p>C<sub class="subscript">f</sub> is the ductility constant
used to adjust the number of cycles to failure. A higher value for
C<sub class="subscript">f</sub> will result in a lower
damage for each cycle. A higher value C<sub
class="subscript">f</sub> translates to a larger number of
cycles to failure.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>C<sub class="subscript">d</sub> is the strength reduction
constant. A larger value for C<sub class="subscript">d</sub>
will result in a lower reduction of strength for each cycle. The four
charts shown in Figure 8 demonstrate the effect that some of the
variables have on the cyclic response.</p>

<p>Figure 8: Fatigue and Degradation Parameter Examples</p>
<p>In Figure 8, the upper left response contains no strength degradation
by setting the C<sub class="subscript">d</sub> variable to
0.0. The upper right response shows strength degradation due to the
suggested values of C<sub class="subscript">f</sub>, a, and
C<sub class="subscript">d</sub>. The response shown on the
lower left demonstrates the change in the response when the suggested
values of C<sub class="subscript">f</sub> and a are used
with C<sub class="subscript">d</sub>=0.6. Making the value
of C<sub class="subscript">d</sub> larger results in less
strength reduction due to damage. The response on the lower right once
again returns to the suggested values but C<sub class="subscript">f</sub> is changed to 0.15. This results in a
more rapid accumulation of damage causing the bar to fail sooner. Note
however that the strength degradation is unaffected by the more rapid
accumulation of damage. The strength reduction and failure are not
interdependent making the model easier to calibrate.</p>
