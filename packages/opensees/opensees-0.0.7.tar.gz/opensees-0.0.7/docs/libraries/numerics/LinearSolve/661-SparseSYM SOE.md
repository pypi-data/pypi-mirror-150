# SparseSYM SOE

This command is used to construct a sparse symmetric system of
equations which uses a row-oriented solution method in the solution
phase. The following command is used to construct such a system:

```tcl
system SparseSYM
```

<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
<li>versions upto and including 2.2.0 use SparseSPD instead of SparseSYM
as the option to the system command. For backward compatability this old
option continues to work.</li>
</ul>
