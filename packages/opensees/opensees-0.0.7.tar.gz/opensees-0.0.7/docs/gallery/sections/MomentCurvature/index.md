# Moment-Curvature (Concrete)

This next example covers the moment-curvature analysis of a reinforced
concrete section. The zero-length element with a fiber discretization of
the cross section is used in the model. In addition, Tcl language
features such as variable and command substitution, expression
evaluation, and procedures are demonstrated.

## Example 2.1

In this example, a moment-curvature analysis of the fiber section is
undertaken. Figure [\[rcsection4$$
](#rcsection4){reference-type="ref"
reference="rcsection4"} shows the fiber discretization for the section.

1.  `Example2.1.tcl`

2.  `MomentCurvature.tcl`

The model consists of two nodes and a ZeroLengthSection element. A
depiction of the element geometry is shown in
figure [\[zerolength$$
](#zerolength){reference-type="ref"
reference="zerolength"}. The drawing on the left of
figure [\[zerolength$$
](#zerolength){reference-type="ref"
reference="zerolength"} shows an edge view of the element where the
local z-axis, as seen on the right side of the figure and in
figure [\[rcsection0$$
](#rcsection0){reference-type="ref"
reference="rcsection0"}, is coming out of the page. Node 1 is completely
restrained, while the applied loads act on node 2. A compressive axial
load, P, of 180 kips is applied to the section during the
moment-curvature analysis.

For the zero length element, a section discretized by concrete and steel
is created to represent the resultant behavior. UniaxialMaterial objects
are created to define the fiber stress-strain relationships: confined
concrete in the column core, unconfined concrete in the column cover,
and reinforcing steel.

The dimensions of the fiber section are shown in
figure [\[rcsection0$$
](#rcsection0){reference-type="ref"
reference="rcsection0"}. The section depth is 24 inches, the width is 15
inches, and there are 1.5 inches of cover around the entire section.
Strong axis bending is about the section z-axis. In fact, the section
z-axis is the strong axis of bending for all fiber sections in planar
problems. The section is separated into confined and unconfined concrete
regions, for which separate fiber discretizations will be generated.
Reinforcing steel bars will be placed around the boundary of the
confined and unconfined regions. The fiber discretization for the
section is shown in
figure [\[rcsection4$$
](#rcsection4){reference-type="ref"
reference="rcsection4"}.

The section analysis is performed by the Tcl procedure MomentCurvature
defined in the file MomentCurvature.tcl. The arguments to the procedure
are the tag of the section to be analyzed, the axial load applied to the
section, the maximum curvature, and the number of displacement
increments to reach the maximum curvature.

The output for the moment-curvature analysis will be the section forces
and deformations, stored in the file section1.out. In addition, an
estimate of the section yield curvature is printed to the screen.

In the script below variables, are set and can then be used with the
syntax of `$variable`. Expressions can be evaluated, although the Tcl
syntax at first appears cumbersome. An expression is given by an expr
command enclosed in square brackets `[]`'s. Typically, the result of an
expression is then set to another variable. A simple example to add `2.0`
to a parameter is shown below:

```{.tcl}
set v 3.0 
set sum [expr $v + 2.0] 
puts $sum;    # print the sum 
```

Comments with `#` can appear on the same line as a command, but then the
command must be terminated with a semi-colon.

The Tcl procedure to perform the moment-curvature analysis follows. In
this procedure, the nodes are defined to be at the same geometric
location and the ZeroLengthSection element is used. A single load step
is performed for the axial load, then the integrator is changed to
DisplacementControl to impose nodal displacements, which map directly to
section deformations. A reference moment of 1.0 is defined in a Linear
time series. For this reference moment, the DisplacementControl
integrator will determine the load factor needed to apply the imposed
displacement. A node recorder is defined to track the moment-curvature
results. The load factor is the moment, and the nodal rotation is in
fact the curvature of the element with zero thickness.

The file section1.out contains for each committed state a line with the
load factor and the rotation at node 3. This can be used to plot the
moment-curvature relationship as shown in
figure [\[momcurv$$
](#momcurv){reference-type="ref"
reference="momcurv"}.
