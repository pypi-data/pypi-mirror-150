# polynom

## (Short) Description

A package to provide polynomials/polynomial-basis-functions for interpolation

provides routines for

  - simple arithmetic
  - (vectorized) evaluation
  - (vectorized) (higher order) differentiation
  - base conversion

supports the following polynomial bases

  - Monomial base
  - Newton base
  - Lagrange base
  - ... others (experimentally)

## Getting Started
