## Installation
The GPU versions depend on `PyTorch`, make sure that you have `CUDA` setup before the installation. 

**From pip**
```python
pip install phycv
```

**From source**
- Download the GitHub repo
- cd to the repo directory
- Run the following command

```python
pip install .
```

## Phase-Stretch Transform (PST)
[Phase Stretch Transform (PST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_stretch_transform) is a computationally efficient edge and texture detection algorithm with exceptional performance in visually impaired images. Inspired by the physics of the photonic time stretch [1], [2] (an ultrafast and single-shot data acquisition technique), the algorithm transforms the image by emulating propagation of light through a device with engineered dispersive/diffractive property followed by coherent detection. For derivations and details, please refer to Reference [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], and the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_stretch_transform).


### PST CPU Version

#### **Code Architect**

```python
class PST:
    def __init__(self, h=None, w=None):

    def load_img(self, img_file):

    def init_kernel(self, phase_strength, warp_strength):
    
    def apply_kernel(self, sigma_LPF, thresh_min, thresh_max, morph_flag):
    
    def run(self, img_file, phase_strength, warp_strength, \
            sigma_LPF, thresh_min, thresh_max, morph_flag):

```
- The `__init__` method has two parameters `h` (height) and `w` (width), which indicates the size of image the algorithm will operate on. They are set to `None` by default. If you leave them as `None` by default, their value will be determined when calling the following `load_img` method. 

- The `load_img` method first loads the image according to the parameter `img_file`, then it converts the image to greyscale if it is in RGB format, if `h` and `w` are not indicated in the `__init__` method, they will be determined by the shape of the image. Otherwise, the image will be reshaped to the indicated size.

- The `init_kernel` method initializes the PST kernel according to the parameters `phase_strength` and `warp_strength`. As for the derivation of the kernel and the physical meaning of parameters, please refer to reference [3], [4].

- The `apply_kernel` method first denoises the loaded image with a low-pass filter characterized by `sigma_LPF`, then it applies the initialized kernel to the denoised image, finally it applies morphological operation if `morph_flag==1`. The thresholds in the morphological operation are indicated by `thresh_min` and `thresh_max`.

- The `run` method wraps `load_img`, `init_kernel`, `apply_kernel` together.

#### **Example Usage**

*Example 1*

In Example 1, all steps are performed in a single `run`. The result is returned as `pst_output`. This is for users who want to get the result on a single image with indicated PST parameters. The example code can also be found in `test_script1.py`

```python
from phycv import PST
pst = PST()
pst_output = pst.run(img_file='./input_images/jet_engine.jpeg', phase_strength=0.3, warp_strength=15, sigma_LPF=0.15, thresh_min=-0.5, thresh_max=0.003, morph_flag=1)
```

*Example 2*

In Example 2, each step is performed seperately. Finally the output is saved as an attribute and can be accessed by `pst.pst_output`. This is for video processing where different frames need to be loaded but the same kernel applies to all the frames, you can call `init_kernel` only once to save computation time for fixed parameters. The example code can also be found in `test_script2.py`.

```python
from phycv import PST
pst = PST()
pst.load_img(img_file='./input_images/jet_engine.jpeg')
pst.init_kernel(phase_strength=0.3, warp_strength=15)
pst.apply_kernel(sigma_LPF=0.15, thresh_min=-0.5, thresh_max=0.003, morph_flag=1)
```

#### **Dependencies**

- Image IO and morphological operation depend on `mahotas`
- matrix operation and FFT depend on `numpy`
- visualization in the test script depends on `matplotlib`


### PST GPU Version

#### **Code Architect**

```python
class PST_GPU:
    def __init__(self, device, h=None, w=None):

    def load_img(self, img_file):
    
    def init_kernel(self, phase_strength, warp_strength):

    def apply_kernel(self, sigma_LPF, thresh_min, thresh_max, morph_flag):
       
    def run(self, img_file, phase_strength, warp_strength, \
            sigma_LPF, thresh_min, thresh_max, morph_flag):

```
The GPU version of PST significantly accelerates the PST algorithm by operating on the GPU. The architect of the `PST_GPU` class is similar to the original `PST` class with same attributes and methods. The main differences are:

1. You have to indicate the `device` to operate on when instantiating the class.
2. The image is loaded as `torch tensor` instead of `numpy array`.
3. The returned result also locates on GPU and is in the form of `torch tensor`.

#### **Example Usage**

*Example 1*

In Example 1, all steps are performed in a single `run`. In the GPU version, you will need to indicate the `device` when instantiate the class. The result is returned as `pst_output`. Note that the returned result locates on GPU and is in the form of `torch tensor`. You may need to move to CPU and convert to `numpy array` for visualization. This is for users who want to get the result on a single image with indicated PST parameters. The example code can also be found in `test_script1.py`

```python
import torch
from phycv import PST_GPU
device = torch.device('cuda')
pst = PST_GPU(device=device)
pst_output = pst.run(img_file='./input_images/jet_engine.jpeg', phase_strength=0.3, warp_strength=15, sigma_LPF=0.15, thresh_min=-0.5, thresh_max=0.003, morph_flag=1)
```

*Example 2*

In Example 2, each step is performed seperately, after  The output is saved as an attribute and can be accessed by `pst.pst_output`. This is for video processing where different frames need to be loaded but the same kernel applies to all the frames, you can call `init_kernel` only once to save computation time for fixed parameters. The example code can also be found in `test_script2.py`.

```python
import torch
from phycv import PST_GPU

pst = PST_GPU(device=device)
pst.load_img(img_file='./input_images/jet_engine.jpeg')
pst.init_kernel(phase_strength=0.3, warp_strength=15)
pst.apply_kernel(sigma_LPF=0.15, thresh_min=-0.5, thresh_max=0.003, morph_flag=1)
```

#### **Dependencies**:

- Image IO is done by `torchvision`
- Matrix operation and FFT are done `torch`
- Morphological operation is done by `kornia`
- visualization in the test script depends on `matplotlib`


## Phase-Stretch Adaptive Gradient-field Extractor (PAGE)

[Phase-Stretch Adaptive Gradient-field Extractor (PAGE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-stretch_Adaptive_Gradient-field_Extractor) is a physics-inspired algorithm for detecting edges and their orientations in digital images at various scales. The algorithm is based on the diffraction equations of optics. Metaphorically speaking, PAGE emulates the physics of birefringent (orientation-dependent) diffractive propagation through a physical device with a specific diffractive structure. The propagation converts a real-valued image into a complex function. Related information is contained in the real and imaginary components of the output. The output represents the phase of the complex function. For derivations and more details please refer to Reference [9],[10] and the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-stretch_Adaptive_Gradient-field_Extractor).

### PAGE CPU Version

#### **Code Architect**

```python
class PAGE:
    def __init__(self,direction_bins, h=None, w=None):

    def load_img(self, img_file):

    def init_kernel(self, mu_1, mu_2, sigma_1, sigma_2, S1, S2):
    
    def apply_kernel(self, sigma_LPF, thresh_min, thresh_max, morph_flag):    

    def create_page_edge(self):

    def run(self, img_file, mu_1, mu_2, sigma_1, sigma_2, S1, S2,\
            sigma_LPF, thresh_min, thresh_max, morph_flag):
```

- To instantiate a `PAGE` class, three parameters `h` (height), `w` (width), and `direction_bins` are needed. `h` and `w` are set to `None` by default. If you leave them as `None` by default, their value will be determined when calling the following `load_img` method. 

- The `load_img` method first loads the image according to the parameter `img_file`, then it converts the image to greyscale if it is in RGB format, if `h` and `w` are not indicated in the `__init__` method, they will be determined by the shape of the image. Otherwise, the image will be reshaped to the indicated size.

- The `init_kernel` method initializes the PAGE kernel according to the parameters `mu_1`, `mu_2`, `sigma_1`, `sigma_2`, `S1`, `S2`. In the CPU version, kernels for different frequency bins are initialized in serial. As for the derivation of the kernel and the physical meaning of parameters, please refer to references [9], [10].

- The `apply_kernel` method first denoises the loaded image with a low-pass filter characterized by `sigma_LPF`, then it applies the initialized kernel to the denoised image, finally it applies morphological operation if `morph_flag==1`. The thresholds in the morphological operation are indicated by `thresh_min` and `thresh_max`.

- The `create_page_edge` method creates a weighted color image of PAGE output to visualize directionality of edges.

- The `run` method wraps `load_img`, `init_kernel`, `apply_kernel`, `create_page_edge` together.

#### **Example Usage**

*Example 1*

In Example 1, all steps are performed in a single `run`. The result is returned as `page_edge`. This is for users who want to get the result on a single image with indicated PAGE parameters. The example code can also be found in `test_script1.py`.

```python
from phycv import PAGE
page = PAGE(direction_bins=10)
page_edge = page.run(img_file='./input_images/jet_engine.jpeg', mu_1=0, mu_2=0.35, sigma_1=0.05, sigma_2=0.7, S1=0.8, S2=0.8, sigma_LPF=0.08, thresh_min=-1, thresh_max=0.0004, morph_flag=1)

```

*Example 2*

In Example 2, each step is performed seperately. Finally the output is saved as an attribute and can be accessed by `page.page_edge`. This is for video processing where different frames need to be loaded but the same kernel applies to all the frames, you can call `init_kernel` only once to save computation time for fixed parameters. The example code can also be found in `test_script2.py`.


```python
from phycv import PAGE
page = PAGE(direction_bins=10)
page.load_img(img_file='./input_images/jet_engine.jpeg')
page.init_kernel(mu_1=0, mu_2=0.35, sigma_1=0.05, sigma_2=0.7, S1=0.8, S2=0.8)
page.apply_kernel(sigma_LPF=0.08, thresh_min=-1, thresh_max=0.0004, morph_flag=1)
page.create_page_edge()
```

#### **Dependencies**:

- Image IO and morphological operation are done by `mahotas`
- matrix operation and FFT are done by `numpy`
- visualization in the test script depends on `matplotlib`


### PAGE GPU Version

#### **Code Architect**

```python
class PAGE_GPU:
    def __init__(self, direction_bins, device, h=None, w=None):

    def load_img(self, img_file):

    def init_kernel(self, mu_1, mu_2, sigma_1, sigma_2, S1, S2):
    
    def apply_kernel(self, sigma_LPF, thresh_min, thresh_max, morph_flag):    

    def create_page_edge(self):

    def run(self, img_file, mu_1, mu_2, sigma_1, sigma_2, S1, S2,\
            sigma_LPF, thresh_min, thresh_max, morph_flag):
```

The GPU version of PAGE significantly accelerates the PAGE algorithm by operating on the GPU. The `init_kernel` and `apply_kernel` are done in parallel. The architect of the `PAGE_GPU` class is similar to the original `PAGE` class with same attributes and methods. The main differences are listed below:

1. You have to indicate the `device` to operate on when instantiating the class.
2. The image is loaded as `torch tensor` instead of `numpy array`.
3. The returned result also locates on GPU and is in the form of `torch tensor`.
4. In the `init_kernel` method, the kernel for different frequency bins are initialized in parallel by using broadcasting. 
5. In the `apply_kernel` method, the kernel for different frequency bins are applied to the image also in parallel by using broadcasting.
