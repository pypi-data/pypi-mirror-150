Notes:
 - With some exceptions, coolant properties are currently evaluated at the bulk temperature, instead of the film temperature. This is because the high wall temperature can sometimes 
   be above the coolant boiling point, which can cause errors. Ideally you would use nucleate boiling correlations in this case, but this is not always possible, and so use the bulk 
   properties is available as a compromise.
