DQO.ai Data Quality Observer
============================

DQO.ai is a Data Observability tool that was designed to analyze the quality of databases, data warehouses and data lakes.
What makes DQO.ai unique is extensibility. DQO.ai comes with a built-in list of verified and proven data quality checks
that are verifying the most important DAMA data quality dimensions. 
New data quality checks may be easily added or built-in checks could be customised to meet the needs.
Data quality checks are separated into the sensor part (a Jinja2 template of the SQL query) and a python rule that
can use custom anomaly prediction logic.

Why should you choose DQO.ai over any other Data Observability tool? The first reason is our extensibility that lets you
define business specific data quality checks. 

Our second reason: DQO.ai is DevOps and MLOps friendly! 

We designed DQO.ai after we had to define 6000 custom data quality checks.
DQO.ai stores all definitions in yaml files. You can store the data quality rules along with your data pipeline code or ML code, just check it to Git.
If that is not enough, just open your text editor of choice on any platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS) and edit your data quality
definition files without even looking into the documentation. DQO.ai supports code completion on all mayor text editors (VSCode, PyCharm, Eclipse to name a few).
