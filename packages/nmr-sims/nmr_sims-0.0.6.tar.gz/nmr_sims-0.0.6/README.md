# nmr\_sims

NMR simulations in Python.

Some rather simple simulations of basic NMR pulse sequences.

Everything uses the Zeeman basis in Hilbert space, so nothing too fancy is possible.

Currently have pulse-acquire, 2DJ, and HSQC code available.

Install with `$pip install nmr-sims`

To get started, take a look at (and run) `$python -m nmr_sims pa`, `$python -m nmr_sims jres` or `$python -m nmr_sims hsqc`.
