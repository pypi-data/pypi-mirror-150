# neoscore

## *notation without bars*

*[Example source](/examples/promo_image.py)*

Neoscore is a Python library for creating scores without limits. While other notation software assumes scores follow a narrow set of rules, neoscore treats scores as shapes and text with as few assumptions as possible. In neoscore, staves and noteheads are just one way of writing. Its programmatic nature makes it especially useful for generative scoremaking, and it even supports experimental animation and live-coding!

## Quick Start

You can install neoscore with pip using `pip install neoscore`, after which you should be able to run this example:

```python
from neoscore.common import *
neoscore.setup()
Text(ORIGIN, None, "Hello, neoscore!")
neoscore.show()
```
