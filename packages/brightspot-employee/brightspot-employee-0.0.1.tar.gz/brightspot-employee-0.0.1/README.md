# brightspot-employee

Simple database library for pulling data from a BrightSpot website.
Default setup can pull employee data from https://religion.byu.edu/directory,
though the Employee and Employee_Processor classes can be overridden easily
to allow scraping data for most websites.
The library also supports using csv files for storing and pulling data.
